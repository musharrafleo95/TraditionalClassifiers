0	1	Enjoyed the food very much. Reminded me so much of Korea.   Its just like the traditional korean bbq where you cook on the grill in front of you. Ordered the marinated kalbi, bulgogi, duck, and steam egg. Will definitely come back and bring more friends.
1	1	yeah all the hype.  all the fuss.  all the food.  all the shakes.  delicious.  I had the hotdog and chicago dog and they were good.  now the coffee fair trade shake, i could not get enough.oh did I mention the coffee shake was delicious?    If you know what you want, there is a virtually no line window outside to get small things like drinks and cements.
2	1	Secret Pizza is so much fun to take people to!  They do pizza exceptionally well...nice crispy bottom, chewy crust, great sauce.  It is not my all-time-favorite or anything, but on taste alone I'd hand out 4.5 stars.    Any two of the following puts it in a unique place that is well deserved of 5 stars for me:  It is called Secret Pizza for a reason, there are no signs; it is not located on the restaurant listing for the Cosmopolitan. Walking down the hall to a hidden gem is half the fun!  Then there is the fact that you can get a quality IPA on tap.  The wall of records is is incredibly cool, and the black & white tile fits so perfectly.  Pizza + secret + atmosphere + IPA = an easy 5 stars in my book.  I will take out-of-town friends here anytime, but i'd also stop in for a slice if I was anywhere near the cosmo!
3	0	This buffet is crap if you eat here at least once a day, which we did for 5 days during our stay. Lunch is basically leftovers from the previous night's dinner, but guess what, the menu never changes! It's the same stuff every day. However, one day, there was NY Steak straight from the grill, but the price per person shoots up to like $40 (not worth it for just steak and the same stuff). One extra star for the frozen yogurt at the dessert area, which I never got sick of.
4	1	Our server  was breeaanda? She was super nice and helpful. We were  originally sat outside but someone in our party had a fear of birds so they were able to relocate us inside. Our server was attentive and help and friendly. Chili Omelet  was the best!!
5	0	first I must say I liked the salad bar area, because they serve it to you and that cuts back on germs and it was good. However the for the price i was expecting more of a selection in foods. The desert section is great. they have cotton candy. My waitress kept getting our drink orders wrong. Oh, and my coffee was lukewarm.  between my husband and myself the meal cost about $50.  I think it was just to expensive for what you get. I will not return there, i have had better buffet  experiences for a lot less money.
6	1	Recently had friends call to say there were coming to visit and wanted to know if I would like to join them at this restaurant.   Reservations were necessary because this place is in high demand and I certainly realized why once we had our meal.  We were beyond happy!  My friend had heard of this place on the food network (she is from North Carolina).    If you want atmosphere you will not find it here but food unbelievable, smiling faces everywhere and those of us lucky enough to live here get to go back. I had the prawns.  You get them with the shells and believe me the way they are prepared you wonder why other restaurants do not prepare them the same way.  Of course we had starters and shared. Each one impressive.    Keep in mind, if you DO get a reservation do not be tardy. They give your table away after so many minutes! My friend called 2 months before they were to fly out here so of course we got our reservation.  Thanks to Anthony Bourdain for saying Lotus of Siam is THE best Thai food he has ever had in all his travels.  My friends and I are fans of his and that is why they knew where to go when they arrived in Vegas.
7	0	Allergy to onions. Food came out with onions. Waited 15 minutes for drinks. No apology from the server. And she charged us for a side of mushrooms...which we never ordered nor did we receive. Manager said she could "look into it," but we had a flight to catch. I suggest waiting in line for ANY other restaurant before getting sat here right away...chances are you'll wait the same amount anyway.
8	1	The food was great!   Our waitress was very occupied though, because I had to ask another waitress twice to get her.  We ordered the buffalo chicken rolls and they were delicious!  Crisp, hot and very good flavor. Then I got the pasta and salad lunch portion.  My pasta was very good. I ordered the Carbonara. A little too much peas for me, but after I picked a few off the top, it was good.  The salad was a small portion of greens on the side, but was perfect since the appetizer filled me up.  I also ordered a Blanco Sangria and it was just a 3 out of 5.  Drinkable, but wouldn't order again.   I really enjoyed the food, so I am still giving this a 5 regardless of the drink and service.  I will return.
9	0	Ordered Baja fish tacos and the shrimp and pork gyoza. The fish tacos were fine, nothing special one way or the other. The filling inside the gyoza was completely undercooked. As in it looked like the filling was tuna ceviche not cooked pork. Disgusting. They brought a new batch which was properly cooked but didn't even offer to take the charge off the bill. Never coming back. Mediocre at best. I'm just thankful I cut into that dumpling before popping the whole thing in my mouth or I would probably be very sick right now...
10	0	Waited 15 mins only to be seated outdoor when we specifically requested indoor.  Looking around in the restaurant there were plenty of empty seats. Not sure who or what they were expecting... We came for some dessert but our stomachs turned when our desserts arrived - massive portions and sloppy presentation.  The taste and quality of food was mediocre.  They get away with overcharging on this garbage made from cheap ingredients.  As well, the interior decorating and ambience was a disappointment too, certainly far from any "Vegas" standard.    You'd be much happier and satisfied by going to Dairy Queen for dessert.
11	1	They take peanut allergies serious here which is great for our family who has many kids with peanut allergies. Everything we had here was made to perfection - the ox tail fries with fried egg on top,  Ronin burger (my personal fav) and the Shogun (foie gras any one?!).  The burger was cooked to perfect medium rare which made it juicy.  I ate everything on my plate and dug into my god daughter's salt/pepper fries with jalepenos.  OMG, my mouth is watering just thinking about our heavenly meal.
12	0	"You get what you pay for"  If only that were the truth.  Let's see....  We got there and: 1) The elevator from the parking structure is out - so we hoof it from the 4th floor all the way to reception with our bags in tow.    2)We got booked into a smoking room when we specifically asked for a non-smoking room  3)We got transferred to a non-smoking room (after a few hours) with a view of the Airport.... well, there would have been a view if the windows weren't so damned grimy  4)Uncomfortable Bed  5)Tube TV that kept cutting out every few minutes, which wouldn't have been bad on its own, but the batteries on the remote were dead.. HAH!  Okay, at 25 bucks a night, I might have agreed that we got what we paid for and it might have been a So-so 2.5 to three stars.  MAYBE.  But when you tack on an additional UNDISCLOSED $15/day "Resort Fee"  (What resort? it was 40 freakin Degrees out!), No Wi-Fi AND $15/day wired internet fee??  ....  Umm... Yeah ... 1.5 stars and I'm not even going to round it up to two.   PROTIP: Hooters appears to be where failed Import model wannabes with bad boob jobs go to die. - Enjoy.
13	1	It's the best oh my gawd just delicious. We stumbled upon this place on accident. Me being a huge music lover I couldn't help but notice all these record covers on the wall. The next thing I knew we were in pizza heaven. We came here about three times on our 4 day trip and had pepperoni and mushrooms. Just delightful. It was almost identical to NY style pizza. It looked just like Ninja turtle pizza. All melty and delicious and it tasted like a slice of heaven. The pepperoni was thick cut and so tasty.
14	0	When there on Sunday nite with my wife to have late dinner. I have been here before food is ok service was good but this time service was terrible , we sat there for 20 min no one showed up I got up and asked one of the girls in front for help and that didn't help, finally a waiter showed up to say hello and left as fast as he showed up. I say if they were busy Ok but they weren't. That's the last time I'm going to go there and would not recommended anybody to go there.
15	1	Since it's opening, it has become a must-do whenever we are in Vegas. Have tried 3 different burgers, all were amazing. Love the curry and chipotle katsups that come with the thick cut fries. Tried a shake for the first time on our last visit. It tasted delicious, but the pudding on top was an unexpected surprise. Expect a long wait at regular meal times. I always grab a pen at the end-- one more touch I love (twice our waitress brought more pens for us)
16	1	Visiting Las Vegas for the weekend and saw that this place had some pretty great reviews. People weren't kidding, it's FANTASTIC. Our server was Liza and she was SO attentive, kind, and helpful. True definition of a great waitress. Everyone's plate was clean at the end of breakfast. I was very impressed with this place and will definitely seek it out again when I'm back in Vegas.
17	1	This is the best Thai restaurant I have to been to.   Didn't expect the food here to be this amazing. It's located in a run down lot a little outside of the strip. Once you get inside the restaurant you see all tons of wine's behind a glass. A big restaurant clean inside that looks nothing like the horrible outside. Service is really attentive and makes sure your table is always clean.   The food here was superb. Next time I come here I'm only ordering the specialty dishes. The typical dishes are great but they have such an awesome menu that every dish we got blew my mind. The tom yum kai soup is delicious and you can't go wrong with that. The pad thai they use thin noodles which made me like it even more! The sea bass drunken noodles was crack. The fish itself was so tender it was like butter. The green curry was another highligh that felt like eating coconut butter on top of rice. I couldn't get enough of it. The raw beef tar tar was light and fresh. The fried rice was good but probably the least memorable of the dishes. Next time I come here I'm getting the deep fried prawns. If you visit Vegas make sure to stop by this place. You will not be disappointed.  Recommendation: Sea Bass Drunken Noodles, Pad Thai, and Green Curry
18	1	A new Must when visiting Las Vegas!!  The food was absolutely delicious!! And the portions were extremely generous. The staff was very friendly and very attentive. Our server Earl made sure we were well taken care of as well as Carole Ann. Definitely coming back!
19	1	Hash House a Go-Go is our Favorite place to bring family and friends when they are visiting from out of town. Breakfast is served all day and our favorite meal to have there. We love when they order pancakes and the shock on their face when the huge plate arrives. Watermelon lemonade is amazing!   First heard about the restaurant  on the Food Network. Everything tastes home cooked and delicious.
20	1	Bouchon is a strikingly casual yet elegant bistro located in the upper reaches of the Venetian hotel.  How casual?  One of our servers did an extended shimmy to a Prince song, there was constant "inappropriate" banter between ourselves and the wonderful individuals who serviced our tables, and there may have been an impromptu coloring session wherein caricatures of patrons at other tables may have been found serenading around the staff's own contribution - the sexy and i know it duck.  So while the high ceilings and beautiful courtyard might suggest one experience, you certainly aren't limited in that manner.    The unanimous decision of our table is that this is the best service we have ever had.  I should explain that.  The balance between entertaining and professional one finds here is something I had previously not experienced.  One might think that perhaps the staff's antics was a convenient mask shrouding potential issues concerning their knowledge of the menu.  That is simply not the case.  We received incredible guidance concerning wine choices and our server hand-picked an off-menu dessert for us (an incredible vanilla bean creme brulee that one international traveler in our group deemed the best she has ever had... it was in my top five as well).  When I can say that people who worked at the restaurant overshadowed a Thomas Keller production in a positive fashion, it becomes at least subjectively obvious that a new dining experience has been created.    That leads us to the food.  Bouchon is one of those few Vegas restaurants that allows friends with different means to comfortably dine with one another.  You don't have to go high-end (I did anyway); as you can see, most Yelp reviews focus on the cheapest dish, a luxuriously decadent take on the Croque Madame, a dish that is fully less than 1/2 the price of the steak.  I am sure it is incredible, yet I would encourage patrons to purchase the steak Bouchon, a blissful cut of New York strip steak doused in black truffle jus and accompanied with celery and potato boulangere.  It was easily the best steak I have had since I have moved to DC, and frankly, may have been the best strip steak I have ever eaten (and yes, this is coming from a Texas guy).  The portion was generous, absolutely perfectly cut, aromatic from the truffle, and intensely flavorful.  I would strongly suggest pairing the steak with the sauteed spinach (brilliant) and potato puree (very buttery).  While it wasn't paired with the steak, the other dish I really enjoyed was the braised cabbage.  I wasn't as enamored by the mac and cheese here, but that isn't to say that it wasn't a solid preparation.    Given that this restaurant delivered on two of arguably the best experiences of my life (best service and potentially best NY strip steak), it is pretty much a no brainer that I would suggest this restaurant to anyone.
21	1	Im in love. The food here was so delicious. So many things to try. I recomend the sukiyaki noodles and the spicy chicken with lemon sauce. For dessert tey the honey bread. Its so fen good. A bit pricey but its worth it. The staff is so friendly, so nice. A must try if your craving korean bbq.
22	0	Oh my, where to start. This is like the Golden Corral's sad disease ridden cousin who lives under the stairs. When I made it over to the buffet it became apparent why they make you pay before you get into the restaurant. The "hot" meats were dry and only barely warm. The cold items were not really. If you eat seafood from this buffet, you are more brave than I am. After trying a several different things, including the taco chicken, and pizza (because how can you mess that up) I decided that the items on the buffet were all upsettingly distasteful and I would just eat salad. They had an olive salad (i love olives), tomato salad (also love tomato salad) and spinach salad. The Olive Salad actually tasted like garbage smells. The Tomato salad was not much better. The best things on the buffet were actually the enchiladas which tasted like they came from the freezer section at a shady grocery store. With all of the other choices around for food, pass on this one.
23	1	The Cosmopolitan Hotel & Casino has a secret and it's hidden on the third floor!  Take the escalator up to the 3rd floor.  As you exit the escalator, there is a hallway directly in front of you to the left of Jaleo (tapas restaurant).  Follow this hallway until it ends and there you will find some of the best pizza on the Las Vegas strip.  Seriously, I saw people waiting in line for crap pizza outside, when they could have easily come here for pizza that is 100 times better.  Sold by the slice or whole, this small spot offers a variety of pies to choose from.  Although it's primarily a counter, there is a small amount of space to eat at.  If not, just go eat in the lounge area directly outside the hidden hallway.  I ordered two pepperoni slices for $5.25 each.  They had just come out of the oven so they were hot.  The cheese was really good and gooey as was the pepperoni itself.  This is definitely worth a visit if you're in the mood for a few slices of pizza.
24	0	Yeah this place is so unfriendly to guys its not even funny. Granted I was with my family so clubbing was more of an afterthought instead of the main event. We didn't have time to go look for passes or get on the guestlist. We get there around 11:30pm. Yeah yeah sorry for being a tourist first. We wait in line for 25 mins in the general admission line and its 20 bucks each.. Me and 3 girls equals 80 bucks WTF. I think tao doesn't know there's a recession or maybe doesn't care. I should have seen it when they walk 12 girls in and 2 mins later they all walk out. If I was with the guys I would have followed them instead going inside. What are they thinking, hot girls never want to pay cover. I did see some guy get in with the laced vans though.  when we get in its a huge cluster f#*k as usual. No room to dance or do anything. We go and head to the bar. 4 drinks were 67 bucks plus tips. At least the bartenders are fast and courteous. It doesn't matter because the marketing genius behind tao wants to shoot foam into the air everywhere, especially into your drink so you can go buy another. Forget about my $300 blazer.   Oh I wanna give a big F U to one of the bouncers. I had this glowstick with me from a concert I brought into the club. I started ravin' out for kicks. Some hot chick on the 'girls catwalk' sees me and asks for it. I ask the bouncer if I can give to her in person. He goes naw, I can't let you walk through the VIP tables... I give it to the bouncer and he walks it over. She blows me a kiss and walks down from the catwalk. I try to going through crowd to meet up but I never see her again. Thanks Mr. cockblocker, you made my night.
25	0	worst place ever... don't ever go.... we decided to take a chance and go in .... looked like a fun place to have breakfast/lunch.... never again... the wait was for 90 minutes even though they said 30 minutes and omg one of the girls in the front needs to get hired.. worst serve ever... she was very rude and people would walk up to her to ask a question and she would just ignore them....  after all that wait the food wasnt even good... just a freaken waste of time... dont waste your time by going in
26	0	What a dive, the tower rooms made the bottom of my feet black , tub, shower don't drain the tub was dirty, ate at the cafe and the buffet and both the casher was pan handling for vets administration so I ask how much do they get and what does the casino take and what are the administration cost , they wasn't able to answer me. Looked at me like I was a complete asshole for asking? Surprised to see a casino panhandling and if you play the table games it does not put any points on your card for food absolutely zero you have to ask for a supervisor and beg to get them to pay for your food , you can spend thousands there and never get a penny's worth of food. I asked him what was up with that and a box man at the craps table told me they were plenty busy. That was The same as telling me we don't need your business. Dirty rooms bad customer service panhandling restaurant cashiers was too much for me looking for a new different place to stay
27	1	My boyfriend was craving some Kbbq and we wanted to try something new apart from Sura and Tofu Hut. I found this place on Yelp so we decided to try it. I wasnt expecting much since yelp stars cant be trusted sometimes. But OMG just as we walked in..Cute Korean Dudes.. lol. No but seriously, the staff were very accommodating and friendly. The place looked very clean, modern and spacious. We got there around 6pm and the place was packed. We got seated shortly after and Calvin, our waiter was very helpful in deciding what to get. We then ordered their Best Seller: Gangnam for 2, $65.95. We felt that the portions were perfect, mann we were stuffed. Then we had Honey Toast and Lava Cake for dessert..yummy! Apparently if you make a yelp review you get either a Lava Cake or Banana Tempura Ice Cream for free.  Our first time experience at this place was awesome. It just might be our new go-to place. The food, and the staff was great. I definitely would recommend this place. It is on the pricey side, but definitely worth it.
28	1	After just having eaten at Joel Robuchon, I did not have an expectation that this restaurant would blow me away. What surprised me was that it did. The service was great, and it was timely. Our waiter even asked if we had plans for a show so they could expedite our meal. I had read on yelp that the rib cap was the thing to get. Two of us ordered that, so I ordered the less recommended Beef Wellington.  It was soooooo good. Tender and flavorful. The sides of spicy corn and the mac and cheese were delicious too. I'm not sure if these are supposed to be family style. They are only $13 I think, but come in small cups. It wasnt really a problem because we are not glutinous pigs. A couple spoonfuls were sufficient for each of the 4 of us. The bread plate was nice. After Joel Robuchon bread cart, it was not about to blow me away, but since we didn't pay $445, I could understand. We got a magnum of Hirsch Pinot for 295, which was good to the last drop. I was surprised at the coffee which came with the ABC liquor spoons. Yummy! The sticky toffee pudding was delicious as expected. Overall I am leaving Vegas thinking about Beef Wellington.
29	1	This place is ridiculously good. I do not hunk that I've had anything bad here.  The burgers are great, my favs are the spicy miso, and the kalbi. The pork belly and duck buns are great. People really like the oxtail chili fries, but they are not my favorite becaus the chili is too sweet and I can't really taste the oxtail a which I love. Service is always decent, never have a complaint
30	0	They have different sections of food, mexican, american, italian, chinese but not a big selection of each. And the food isnt the best. We went there bc of the unlimited beer, but it was only bud light and some other beer. It was too pricy for the selection if u ask me. $37 for dinner.
31	1	This dining experience did not disappoint!  From the amazing bread, to the famous Beef Wellington for 2!  The service is impeccable, food outstanding, and the atmosphere was beautiful.  The Wellington was tender enough to cut with a fork, and that is not an exaggeration!  We will be back, 5 stars+++, just go and enjoy the experience, you cant get it many places!
32	1	This place is awesome! Fun atmosphere, delicious food, and reasonable price! FYI if you are a Diamond or Seven Stars member of the Ceasars Rewards program they have reserved tables for you and you don't have to wait in line. I tried this the second to last day of my stay and like it so much went back for lunch the next day. The Hummus is amazing, and it comes with pita and assorted veggies to dip.  The veggies are unique, I couldn't really tell exactly what they were but I think I had a baby yellow carrot. It bursted with flavor. We also tried the chicken sliders, they were just the right size. The chicken was perfectly cooked an moist. I usually don't like chicken in restaurants because they over cook it and make it dry. The day prior we had a burger that had some type of chutney on it and we added avocado. Wow!!!! No wonder this place is called BurgR they got it down!!! If you come here make sure you try a burger even if you have to split with someone because you are missing out otherwise. Now both I got the wings as well. They have a unique sauce on them that also goes well with the fries. We ordered extra. Don't worry they aren't too spicy at all in fact the flavor is so unique you will just keep eating them trying to figure out exactly what makes them so delicious. The service here is top notch. The men all wear jeans, and nice clean cut form fitting shirts. And the women had either skirts or pants. It was cute because all wore uniforms but not your typical uniforms. And they sported them like they enjoyed wearing them as well. All the waiters and waitress's appeared to be in athletic shape and well groomed. The service was impeccable and they constantly insured we were well taken care of. I will probably get something here upon every stay now. Delicous! Awesome Job to the Gordon Ramsay Burger Team! You are all doing amazing!!!!
33	0	This place is awful and I can't even believe Caesars palace allows this place to stay in business. When I think of quality I think of Caesars and this was not it.  I have been there before and it wasn't that good so i thought maybe they were having an off day but it seems that's standard operating procedure.  We had the beef brisket noodle soup and it was awful. The beef was 3 chunks of boney fatty I don't even want to call it beef that would be an insult to the cow. The soup was cold! It's a noodle company according to the name and they can't even warm up the soup?!  For $16 I could of eaten an entire smorgasbord in Chinatown for that price. I also had the red bean bun and it was the worst red bean bun I have ever had.  You can go into Chinatown and have dim sum and get the best red bean buns at Orchid Garden.  If I was from Beijing I would be insulted that they were trying to pass this off as something from there.  It was very disappointing.  I guess I'm gonna have to go to Chinatown to get a descent bowl of noodles and hand made red bean buns.
34	0	Horrible.  The food was so chewy and uneatable and the service was so bad.    I mean, our waiter was nice when she was at our table, but she wasn't at the table to often.   We had to always call for her, she would say "yes I'll be right there" then she would walk away and not come to us.   The shrimps and muscles were very fishy and the meat was so chewy like gum.  I did not enjoy my dinner here at all.  One good thing about this place is the olives at the salad bar.  They were very yummy. I'm not the only one who was annoyed.  There was a couple at the other table for 5+ minutes and no one came and took their drink orders.  When they came up to the waitress she had told them "oh we're not serving at that table".     Why would you seat people there if you aren't serving at that table? And mind you, the servers passed by this couple multiple times and didn't tell them anything.  Eventually they moved the couple to a different table.   Anyways, to conclude my thoughts, I will not come here again. Horrible first experience.
35	0	Ummmm totally not worth it!  We wanted to try a different restaurant at our last stay in Vegas. We were originally going to eat Wicked Spoon but the line was long and last call was in 45 minutes. We knew we weren't going to have enough time to eat.   Thankfully, it was only lunch so we weren't TOO HUNGRY so we decided to switch it up and try China Poblano. I first noticed it was owned by chef Jose Andres. I had a bad experience with Chef Andres and truthfully, didn't enjoy his restaurant over in LA at the Bazaar. So I decided to give him another try.  It was pretty empty upon walking in. We were seated promptly and service was fast. First off, we decided to order some soda because we were thirsty and the waitress comes out with these dinky small soda cans!!! Those sodas were $5!!! We orders some ceviche, tacos, dan dan mien, and chilaquiles. My overall favorite was their ceviche. Decent flavor with a good amount of tuna. Nothing spectacular though. Different cuisines are prepared in different kitchens so food comes out at off times. Their noodles were okay. A good kick of spice but obviously not traditional. The chilaquiles was a joke. Basically tortilla chips with sauce on top. Looked like a cheap mans version of nachos. Can't believe we paid $15 for it. Everything's on the lighter smaller side so be prepared to either eat light or order a lot!  After lunch, that was it. Again, nothing too spectacular. Food is expensive and small. It's much more worth it to spend your money somewhere else. Not missing out if you haven't tried this place at Cosmo.
36	0	I really was expecting more from this. My mac and cheese was kinda bleh. I figured a place that was known for hot chocolate...er frozen, whatever...would have comfort food down pat. Getting seated was kind of a nightmare, and the atmosphere was too bright and crowded for my taste.   I would have tried it again, but several months later I found Max Brenner, which was everything I wanted Serendipity to be.
37	1	We have long anticipated having dinner here and with all the hype over Gordon's celebrity and the Hell's Kitchen competition, it did not let us down. The service was exceptional: from giving us an ipad with the drink menu on it allowing us to email ourselves information on the wine we drank; to cleaning the table of crumbs and replacing the cutlery between each course; to placing our plates of food on the table simultaneously with 2 servers. The food was fantastic. Melt in your mouth, and even though we were stuffed we had to have the toffee pudding which was to die for! We will visit again on our next trip to Vegas!
38	0	I purchased a Groupon for my Vegas trip.  The reviews were mainly average or bad so I took a chance.  What an idiot I am!!  There was a wait which was fine.  I gave my name and number to the semi-nice host for a text message when table will be ready.  She said 15 mins.  I decided to go gamble.  The machine was paying too, however I realized it was well over 15 mins and went back to host.  She said she tried texting me 3 times and showed her logs, which is odd.  I received other text messages and FB messages but not hers. She placed me back on "the list."  About 5 mins later another hostess sat me and hub, she was not friendly.  The decor was nice, semi-clean.  The server was all over the place.  We had to hunt for her a couple of times.  She tried to be friendly but she appeared that she was overworked and just started that day.  The food was not good.  I would have done better looking for a Taco Bell.  Trust me....forget this place, so not worth your time and money.
39	0	Nothing to write home about.  Fancy noodle guy making the them from scratch. ....but the window dressing really didn't match or meet expectations.  In fact, a trip to Panda Express would have saved me $70 and we would have had a better meal.    Never again!
40	0	the food was good and so was the iced coffee but they really did not want to give me much coffee. the first time i went there i got a regular size iced coffee and it was more like a cup of ice with coffee. it was delicious so i decided to go the following day, i ordered another iced coffee, this time i asked for less ice. when i got my coffee, it was filed up 3/4 way, i asked the cashier sarcastically "you guys dont fill up the cup" and all he told me was "u asked for less ice". it was disappointing, i would look for  new place with good iced coffee because they just dont really want to give you your money's worth,
41	0	Do not come here.. Horrible service.. bland food.. waste of time.. Go to Earl Sandwiches instead.    Came here Fri after a night out.. Sat early AM.. and ordered the congee and the duck soup... YUCK.. Worst $23 spent ever and horrible service! Why did it take 30 minutes to get our food? 2 items? No cooking needed, just scooping the soup up... the congee was so bland.. drinking water was better that that.. and the duck soup..The noodles weren't even cooked all the way!  It was still all stuck together.. Waste of time and money.. and it was so hard to track down our server, let alone trying to pay our bill... Wish we just walked out..
42	1	Absolutely love this place!! I loved the concept of an Asian fusion and everything I ate was delicious! A little upset I came in while somewhat hungover, thanks to open bar at Senor Frogs. I didn't finish my food cause my stomach was still a little upset. BUT, it was BOMB!  Husband and I shared the fried chicken wings. I'm telling you, you'd be a fool not to order them. Best wings I've ever had!! We also shared the salt and pepper garlic fries. Again.. The best ever!!  I ordered the Miyagi-San burger with grilled onions instead of onion rings. The meat was flavored SO WELL and I loved the over easy fried egg.  My husband ordered the Kiki burger and I swear I looked down at my food, then up at his and it was gone. That good!!!
43	0	The set up of this restaurant is pretty cool. It's very casual with like sandwiches, salads and things as their food. My cousin and I just really wanted some fries, and we were really disappointed. We ordered just a side of fries, and when it came out we could tell that the fries were old and re-fried. We wanted to make a comment but we were in too much of a rush to tell the cashier. I will come back again and give this restaurant another shot. However, I may not order their fries this time. ENJOY!

Customer service here was the worst part.  We waited at least 20 minutes for our water that we were charged a "water surcharge" for. The waitress seemed very confused.   The seating is very close to the other diners so if they are experiencing problems you know about it.  The people next to us bought a very expensive package and never received most of the perks that went with it.  Mainly the lobster.  The food at the salad bar was just ok. Not worth the price they were charging.   In my opinion, go to Fogo or Texas de Brazil if you want a good Brazilian experience.    Don't waist our time here.
45	1	Korean fusion at its finest! It is really no wonder to me that this place has been reported to serve the best burger in LV. The burgers here all are so amazing with diverse flavors yet still maintain the classic burger necessities of a quality tasting patty sandwiched between a great bun. I am in love with the buns here thats for sure. They are fluffy, moist, crispy, and buttery heaven. I think part of the reason why i really love this place is because I love Korean food and all that it offers with spicy and diversity in the food. And I love burgers so its the best of both worlds.   I think my favorite burger on the menu has to be the Miyagi Son. It provides a really simple flavor that really packs a punch! The Ronin is a classic as well. They also let you mix it up and customize your burgers so if you're feeling like kimchi on your burger, go for it.   The oxtail chili cheese fries are a must in my opinion. Obviously, anything with a fried egg and garlic aioli on it is going to be delicious but really the flavors on these fries are unreal! They also have a great selection of boba teas if you feel like getting your boba on!
46	1	Admittedly, I would have given this place four stars due to the sheer exorbitant prices if it weren't for the amazing, if not the best, burgers I have had in my 26 years of life. And believe me, I've had my fair share of burgers. Okay - enough about the rave and onto the food:  I must start with the free starter popcorn, which was perfectly salted and just the right amount of butter so good that I had to ask for second!  For appetizer, we ordered the Surf and Turf Quesadillas, which has a combination of broiled steak and lobster that complements surprisingly well topped off with Manchego cheese to give it a rich texture to go along with Avocado cream that leaves a rather refreshing after taste  For main course, I ordered the Rising Sun burger (A must have based on other yelpers' validations) and the steak fries as a side. The juicy Kobe beef spread with the Teriyaki glaze just burst with flavor, but not too salty as it is matched with a slightly sweet addition from the cripsy yam. At the same time, the Spicy mayo and tempura avocada adds a tantalizing kick to the already delicious burger all on its own. I also added a fried Egg which just kicks it up another notch. The steak fries that came with the burger just left me speechless as I could not even taste the grease but had so much crisp and flavor that left me licking the seasoning off of my thumbs   All in all, what more can you ask for than a perfect burger and a beer in a chilling afternoon at Vegas? I would have liked to try Truffle lobster Mac N Cheese but there just was not enough stomach to fit it all or time on the agenda to come back for round 2. Definitely a 5 star unforgettable experience - Super winning!
47	1	It's the place to get a burger.  It's a tradition for our group of friends when we visit Vegas to head over to Burger Bar for dinner.  Build your own burger with best ingredients.  Sides are good too.  100% of the time I've gone to Burger Bar, my burger is cooked perfectly the way I order.  For fresh fancy burgers, medium rare is the way to go in my opinion.  Plus, this week when went, for the 1st time we ordered the Kobe Burger to see what the hype was about.  YUM.  Kobe Burger lives up to it's hype for sure.  (oh and once, a friend ordered veggie patty and vinaigrette salad, she wasn't super happy with her meal).  Burger Bar = stick w/ the burgers.
48	0	I came here mostly because I had a buy one get one free coupon for cocktails. The disclaimer says under 9 dollars... Too bad there are 0 cocktails for under 12 dollars so I just stuck with a water.   My girlfriend got a wet burrito and she ate just a bit because it was "way too dry". How does that happen with a wet burrito?   I ordered a BBQ pulled pork. It was the worst thing I've ever had in my life. It had drown in so much sweet BBQ sauce that chewing it down was almost torture. The sweet fries are on par with Applebee's. I was looking forward the corn on the cob for a nice crunch but it was actually soggy like it was dropped in a puddle. I've honestly never heard of soggy corn. Was this done on purpose? How do you mess up that bad?  The best part was watching some drunk kid sing karaoke from my sticky table.  Instead of going to the casino after, I just went up to my room.  I'm actually writing this from my toilet. Wish me luck.
49	0	We had to pay almost $5.00 for a bowl of RICE!  I could not believe that the main dish did not come with anything else.  Everything is ordered separately.  I know it's Caesar's at the Las Vegas strip, but please, four entrees, four bowls of rice and three teas, one had water, cost over $100 for lunch!!!
50	0	Dear Hooters Las Vegas,  I have always enjoyed my stays at Hooters Las Vegas. Unfortunately that was not the case this weekend. I checked into the hotel on December 5th and was given room 263 in the Bungalow tower. The room was nice as I expected. The next morning on Saturday December 6, my boyfriend and I noticed the hot water was not working in the shower. I called the front desk and they said they would send somebody right away. After waiting half an hour nobody had arrived. I went ahead and left the room and went to the front desk where a gentleman named Marco assisted me. Marco said that he would give us a separate room to shower in. He offered room 448 in the OCEAN tower. I thought that it was completely ridiculous to walk all the way across the casino and take an elevator just to shower. When I complained they said we could just keep the  ocean tower room to stay. (Why did they not offer that in the first place?) the manager also reversed my resort fee which was very appreciated.   After packing up all our stuff we switched rooms at about 12pm. We left the room for the day to visit the strip. We came back to the room at about 530 pm and took a nap. At about 820pm my boyfriend woke up to take a shower. As he closed the bathroom door I HEAR THE DOOR TO THE HOTEL ROOM  OPEN. Keep in mind I am in a t-shirt and underwear laying on the bed! I look up and see a glimpse of somebody walking away quickly and closing the door. Confused I call my boyfriend asking if he left the room and he said no that he was still in the shower. I was completely frightened because someone was able TO OPEN MY HOTEL ROOM DOOR AND WALK IN.  About 5 minutes later someone starts to furiously knock on our door, I open it and a lady in a blue shirt and a man in a black jacket/maroon shirt start questioning me. They state I was supposed to check out today and should not be in the room. When I explain the situation about switching rooms they ask to see my ID. When they check my ID they said thank you and did not even apologize. After a few minutes I walk down to the front desk asking why someone opened my room door without knocking, the manager named "H" (who was also the lady in the blue shirt who checked my ID) denied that anyone opened the door before they knocked. I was extremely upset at this because I know what I saw and heard. She completely denied that anybody opened the door without permission. I am extremely upset at this situation as hooters violated my privacy and also did not take the liberty to update their system to acknowledge my new hotel room. I would like a refund for my weekend.
51	1	I've been going to the Shake Shack for years in Philly and NYC, and being on the West Coast now, I was so excited to see the beloved establishment in Vegas. I was in Vegas for 5 days, I went to the Shake Shack 5 times. - I always go for the Double Shack Burger - the beef is super moist, seasoned, tasty. The cheese is delicious as well. - Crinkle cut fries - get them with cheese on it! - Concretes are solid as well. Be prepared for a quality, delicious burger here. The only drawback is I wish it were bigger!
52	1	This is my favorite place to order Huevos Rancheros. I like that it's made with crispy tortillas and every thing about it is delicious. The very best I have had. The sauce is outstanding! This is not an ordinary Huevos Rancheros. Not typical at all. Try it. Even the employees rave about it.
53	0	I made the mistake of having such high expectations of China Poblano because they were just completely crushed.  I had heard so much about  culinary genius, Jose Andres and that is the reason I even went into the restaurant after perusing the menu.  If it was not associated with Jose Andres, I would have immediately done a 180 after seeing the $11.00 price tag on a serving a dim sum.    Jose Andres is known for his tapas servings and so our group ordered a number of tapas servings to share.  And they were just OK.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't mind blowing either.  If I am paying $8 for a mini mini pork sandwich- it BETTER blow my mind, and it did not.  My favorite dish was the eggplant dish, but it wasn't fabulous enough for me to return. I even tried eating the Chinese dish and Mexican dish, side by side to see if that would make a difference in the "experience", but it didn't.  In fact, I still don't get it.  It was not a fusion restaurant, but rather two menus in one.   The ambience is cool and trendy, but next time I am considering Mexican or Chinese, I will definitely go elsewhere, where the flavor satisfaction matches the price.  I can get ambience elsewhere.
54	0	This is a review of the restaurant inside.  Like so many others, my experience here consisted of questionable food and an unfriendly waiter, who didn't trouble himself to stop by our table even once to ask us if we wanted another beverage or anything else. He sure had time though to stand around looking bored, talking to his buddy near the back where I watched him do absolutely nothing for 20 minutes. So I decided to just walk up to the bar to get my own drink where I was met, eventually, by an ill-tempered gal who did nothing more than raise her eyebrows when I asked for a beverage. The chicken was overdone on the outside, underdone on the inside- shrimp like rubber. Straight up- this place is bad, stay away.
55	1	Went in with low expectations... Thinking it would be cheesy, expensive, mediocre food and small portions.  I was blown away on all accounts. Drinks were huge, portions were generous and the food was DELICIOUS and met the standards of a fine dining institution.   The Ramsay brand did not let down!  P.S. Beef Wellington FTW
56	0	I had an absolutely terrible experience here and I think it ruined the celebrity chef name too.  This was last summer and I finally got around to writing the review. I still have the bad aftertaste in my mouth and I swore never to go back there again. EVER. I'd love to give them zero star if I could.   The service: slow and inattentive.  The communication between servers and chefs was terrible - our dish somehow went "missing" and we waited and waited, we didn't get any apologies for that.  We ordered our drinks first hand, but the drinks came towards the end of the dinner. If we didn't remind them, we probably wouldn't have gotten them.   Their guac was so bland and expensive. We mixed it with the salsa because it was that bland. I can make a better batch of guacamole for 10th of the price. The siu mai was just bad. Everything was so small and expensive for no apparent reason. I'm sorry I even wasted time and money on this place.   Ok, maybe it's fine to go one time for the novelty of the Mexican/Chinese fusion idea, but definitely not worth the price. They made so many mistakes and failed to make up for it all! The waitress came and suggested that she was sorry, but please, we all knew she didn't mean any of it when she sounded and looked so irritated the whole time that I was complaining about the entire experience in front of her. I don't remember if I tipped, but if I did, I shouldn't have.
57	0	If you get this worthless one for 10 bucks  It may still be a bad deal . got it for 20 from half price tickets.please find another buffet to goto.bad food.mediocre taste.reminded me a of a family run Chinese hotel.mind you Chinese options suck as well
58	0	Came in with a party of 12 under a reservation. It took 50 minutes to place our order for food, after an hour seated we finally got our drink order. If you want a burger, one could literally butcher a cow, grind the beef, and cook it yourself faster than the "service" at this restaurant. One could probably drill a well for water faster than they brought it to the table, as well.
59	1	I'm thinking this is the cheapest thing you can buy here at the Cosmopolitan.   Another amazing recommendation from Kristen C. she said I had to try it after a long night of partying. It's $3-$5 dollars depending on the pizza and it's amazing!!! It's good when you're intoxicated and better when you're sober. It's a New York style pizza in Vegas!! Can't ask for anything better. I love a plain cheese pizza and this is one of the best cheese pizza I've had. Well worth my $3 and more. I also tried a white pizza with garlic parmesan, ricotta and mozzarella cheese YUMM.  I will say it's was a bit tricky to find, there isn't a sign outside and you have to walk through a dark hallway before seeing the pizzeria but if you can find it or flirt w/ a security guard to help you out (lol that's how I found it) then you'll be very happy when you do!!   Yummm, I'd love a slice right now!!
60	1	Great environment. The wait wasn't too bad Friday morning. They are very attentive. Got the enchilada omelet and really liked it. What I liked more was the potatoes. Seasoning was amazing on the potatoes. The banana muffin you get for free is surprisingly good too.
61	0	Went for breakfast and waited forever at the front for the rude hostess to even look at us.  Some bitchy granny seated is and lectured us about the dos and don'ts of eating breakfast.  Breakfast buffet was $16.00.  Because everything was not to my liking, I basically left there hungry.  The bacon was like chewing on plastic with artificial bacon flavoring.  The eggs were...(I have no words for them).  The only edible things were the fruits as they did not require cooking.  It was THE MOST DISGUSTING BREAKFAST I HAVE EVER HAD and so not worth $16. I had breakfast buffet at Mandalay Bay the previous day and it was awesome.   Do not eat here unless you have no other option. Between the disgusting food and the unfriendly staff, I can not understand why this dump exists in the basement of the hotels, which smells like a backed up sewer, by the way.
62	1	The place is definitely hidden. First time I came here I wasn't sober enough to remember lol But I remembered enjoying the pizza.  The quality is good, I want to try all of their toppings! Order the one you want and they'll pop it into the oven for few minutes to warm it up :)  It's open super late so you can stop by for a late night drunchie after marquee. The price is very reasonable (especially in Cosmopolitan!).   There are more comfortable seatings outside. Look for the huge red couch!!!! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-cosmopolitan-of-las-vegas-las-vegas?select=nj_b27TPNvVtHKkqxo53oA#nj_b27TPNvVtHKkqxo53oA
63	1	Was awesome. Was told an hour & 20 minute wait. Waited for 45. Didn't have to stand there, they texted us when our table was ready so we could walk around the mall. We were seated promptly and the waiter was really kind. Soon as I seen the Farm Burger, I knew I HAD to get it. Duck bacon, cheddar & a fried egg. Food came out really fast I was shocked being that they were really busy. Everything was so good. I should've gotten two. Great experience.
64	1	This is the first of 3 reviews I will hopefully post for Thomas Keller's Restaurants.  While probably the least popular of his culinary trifecta of Bouchon (vegas & yountville), French Laundry, and Per Se, starting off with this restaurant is nothing to be ashamed of.  If you scroll down to Seth W.'s review, I was also in his party of 12 that drank the absinthe and easily had one of the best dining experiences of my life, with good food, good drink, and excellent company.    The first thing that showed me this is a quality restaurant was the excellent, attentive wait staff.  Starting off with a very knowledgeable waiter (who else can explain why castrated chicken is more tasty and juicy?), to a well-versed sommelier who taught us the history of absinthe, we were taken care of through the entirety of our meal.  We started off with an amuse bouche of salmon spread with salmon cooked a few different ways (smoked, pureed, etc.).  Had I known about this, I probably wouldn't have ordered the salmon tartare appetizer, as this tasted a little bit better.  The consistency was such that you could take a butter knife and spread it across the biscuit.  The salmon tartare starter had a similar taste, except it was surrounded by bits of hard boiled egg.  I can't say that it did or didn't complement the tartare well, but the amuse bouche was definitely better tasting without any extraneous tastes that the egg brought.  Never fear though, as I'm confident that I got the best main course of the table.  The Epaule de Porc is a braised pork shoulder with glazed root vegetables, celeriac remoulade & pork jus (quoted from the menu).  In everyday speak, this is the most tender pork that exists.  Saying that it melts in your mouth is an understatement.  Think about a warm tasty porky marshmallow that gives you feelings of the first time you made love, but not as short lasting.  That's about as close as I can put into words to describe this amazing dish.  Putting it in perspective, having this kind of amazing meal for under $100 in Vegas (not to mention in the Venetian) is quite a steal.
65	1	I actually enjoyed the food. My friend had the beef wellington-5 stars! I had the rib eye steak, so huge but delicious. I added a sauce which was a bone marrow in red or white wine. Pretty good but a little salty. The restaurant lives up to its' name. The setting is pretty dark and red inside. Their service was excellent! Someone is always making sure you enjoyed your food and pouring water for you when your cup gets emptied or half full.   TRY the beef wellington, brussel sprouts (has bacon in it)  & mac & cheese! The 3 best combo & for appetizer their lobster.. haha JUST TRY IT!!
66	1	The experience  itself is worth more than 5 stars, let alone the extravagant, picture perfect, work-of-art food. Plate by plate files by you of simply gorgeously displayed craftsmanship on a plate. Does it match up to the visual when it comes down to taste? You betcha! And beyond.  A towering stack of waffles and sagely spiced fried chicken, mounded with fried leeks (Do I eat leeks? I do now!!!). Added an order of scrambled eggs, which it seems silly to say but they were truly the best prepared I can remember. The two of us shared the waffle creation and had more than enough food.  The second Saturday of the month apparently they have this rousing DJ that sets everybody rocking to breakfast. Fun, inventive, artistic food with an attitude and a joint making a statement of swinging for the fences. Loved the experiance and the food!
67	0	Stay somewhere else!!!   Called the front desk at 8am to fix the shower...ummm it's only 3pm still can't shower?!?   Waited in line over an hour to check in. Rude front desk.  With all the choices in Vegas save yourself some disappointment and stay elsewhere anywhere else!
68	1	04/10/2014:  This place is a must for Thai food lovers visiting Vegas. It is a bit off the strip, but, worth the drive. And you'll likely have to wait a while unless you were lucky to get through ahead of time to make a reservation. The cab drivers will also vouch for the popularity and demand of this place.   We had the usual Pad Thai and Papaya Salad for appetizers. The grilled shrimp, green, red, and yellow curries are all good. The squid salad is excellent. The basil and garlic eggplant dish is excellent. You can substitute green beans if you're not a fan of eggplant. If you like your food spicy and your guests do not, make sure to ask for the fish sauce and fresh Thai bird chillies. That gives it a nice kick. Just be careful, it can make a grown man cry. One if our guests tried some and had tears run down his face as he grabbed for the Chang beer.   Chang beer is the best pairing for Thai food - IMHO. They have a huge wine cellar and it sure looks impressive behind the glass room. However, I just can't seem to muster up the taste buds to pair this amazing Thai food with wine.   I have been to this restaurant several times before. Finally making the time to recognize this place for the fine food it produces. I've turned a few business clients on to this place. They are hooked too. Always a must for me when in Vegas. Some reviewers describe this place as the best Thai food in the US, it's hard to argue with them.
69	0	The worst of the worst...... Omg....... Don't even think or get attempt by it from buy one get one coupon....  Horrible... Very narrow choices of food and taste is the worst.. Everything is either sweet or way too salty... I couldn't even eat two plates... Will never come back....
70	0	The customer service was very nasty!! I will never go here again and will pass the word on to friends and family!! I never would have expected to watch some as whole throw my food into the bag because the cashier as whole didn't confirm that it was and order to GO!  Got into a verbal confutation with the lady who threw my food in the bag!!.. Since I didn't have bail$$ I let her keep her teeth...  A little encouragement to the as whole lady please find yourself another job if you're unhappy with the Hot Dogs business!! The Original Pinks is in Los Angeles Ca. a much better place to go and eat a hot dog and know the customer service there has better class.
71	1	Oh Bouchon Las Vegas. I'd love to able to say that I've had to pleasure of enjoying the food from the Yountville establishment, but my travels have brought me to Vegas before that.  Greg and I selected Bouchon after looking at the menu (extensively) and the wine list (more extensively) and thought that this would be one of the shining moments in our trip, assuming we didn't win millions of dollars in the casino.  As it turns out, I'd say this was a pretty awesome experience and not anything that felt like were in Vegas at a hotel on the Strip.  After being seated we were given bread on the table, and told that the bread was meant to be eaten with the room temperature butter (hard table butter = loss of a star) and some Dijon mustard.  Absolutely delicious, and continued to eat through two servings of the bread.  Our waiter, who I am TERRIBLY sorry to have forgotten his name, was warm, pleasant, not cheesy and very informative.  He helped Greg select a bottle of wine for us and also helped select a sampling of the fromage from the menu.  Ultimately, we selected the Bleu d'Auvergne, Pont l'Evque, and the Fiscalini Bandaged Cheddar.  The cheeses were accompanied with some fuji apple slices and honeycomb, along with cranberry walnut toasts.  We agreed that the top two cheeses from the selection were the Bleu and Cheddar cheeses.  The third cheese was a little too stinky for our liking, even with the honey and apples.  For our appetizer, we selected the Molle Rtie, or the bone marrow dish.    And here is where I completely break down.  This dish falls into the category of dishes I would have no shame in licking the plate.  The bone marrow, served with two bones and toasts to accompany, was soft, delicate, and melted onto the toasts.  The part that blew my mind = the reduction sauce that comes with it.  I mean, this sauce is COMPLETELY out of this world.  The consistency was just a touch lighter than French Onion soup but came with all the wonderful flavors including juices from the bones.  I mean, this dish in itself is worth coming here for.  We asked for more bread so that we could dip it into the sauce, secretly debating whether or not we should go as far as licking the plate.  I was sad when they took the empty plate away.  Our waiter was gracious enough to warn us that the Steak Frites came with a mountain of fries, and since we were both ordering it, that one of us have a side of steamed garlic spinach instead.  Completely insightful and helpful when I saw the Mt. Everest of fries piled onto the plate.  The steak came with an herb butter and was a generous sized portion.  Greg and I literally ate until it became unbelievably uncomfortable, which meant that we had only gotten through about 80% of the steak and 60% of the fries.  I was saddened by the fact that I had overindulged in the things leading up to this, but had no regrets in doing so. Ultimately, the poor little side of delicious garlic spinach sat half done and I really made an effort to finish my plate but had to wave the white flag before it was gone.  Naturally, we passed on dessert although I had a cappuccino to try and start the digestion process and enjoyed being in each other's company for the rest of the time.    This was a great experience, and we really enjoyed everything about Bouchon.  Previously we had been to Bradley Ogden in Caesar's and was sort of so-so on the whole dining experience.  I'm glad we selected Bouchon, it completely exceeded our expectations and created a new standard for fine dining in our opinion.
72	1	You see that "R" by my name? I'm a regular here and I don't even live in Vegas. That's how much I've been here. Oh, do I miss the 7am breakfast after a long night... and I just got back from Vegas a few days ago. This was the closer of the night/morning. After a grueling night with the City of Sin, we, along with many others, find ourselves here at the Grand Lux Cafe. I think I've been here 4 times in 3 days.   The food is surprisingly very good! I ordered the pizza lunch special on my first visit and loved it. It didn't get me stuffed but I was full and content. Better than eating a buffet, where I always over eat and feel like crap come dinner time. Came back the next morning... or some would call it... a few hours later and had the "healthy breakfast" which consisted of chicken breast, egg whites and some veggies. I did not expect it to be good, and it wasn't but it wasn't bad either... it was healthy (understandable).   Had a legit breakfast here (like actually waking up in the morning and coming here). The breakfast buffet was excellent! The selection was very limited but the items that they have were all great. The hash browns were cooked to perfection, not burnt but not undercooked. The omelets were great too.   Lastly, had one last breakfast, this time it wasn't legit (due to the fact that there was no sleep prior to this breakfast) Don't know what I ordered, could be my lack of memory, or we can just blame it on the night.   Now to the service. It was excellent every time we were there (and I remembered). I must say though, our waitress for breakfast was absolutely wonderful. Definition of great customer service! If i knew her name I'd let you guys know... but the entire staff at the Grand Lux is amazing. Great service!
73	0	Was excited to come to the Riv again since they announced t was being demolished.  Had such great memories here as a kid.  But WOW was it BAD!!  The only thing that was god was the parking.  Both myself and my daughter got ill after eating breakfast in the caf.  For 3 breakfast items it was over $50 with a tip and it was HORRIBLE!!!  Very sad to see this historic landmark go but employees have already checked out.  Stay away and go somewhere else.
74	0	Literally every section has the same three items ( bacon, eggs, and sausages). There's a very small selection. This will be my last time eating here. Awful food and service during breakfast. I'm highly disappointed that I wasted my money and time waiting in line.
75	1	Oh have mercy on my soul THIS was amazing!!! We were seated right away, the service was incredible and the FOOD oh man, so good wish I had another stomach! We started with the Ox tail chili fries THAT alone sold me on the place. Then we had the Bahn-mi burger and the Ronin burger holy mother of god they were SOOO delicious. Our server came and checked on us without overly checking, which was great because we were too busy stuffing our faces! LOL we then finished off the meal with Portuguese doughnuts...the coffee ice cream was to die for. I can honestly say, THIS has been such a great food orgasmic experience that we will ALWAYS come here when we're in town! Thank you for the amazing food and service! An absolute must if your in town!
76	1	I don't eat much Thai food.. came here purely because of the hype from online reviews, and realizing I've never been to a Thai restaurant with such acclaim.  Plus this was one of the few times I had a rental car available when visiting Vegas.  Fresh and marinated raw prawns with chili paste.. what a great and unique dish. The serving came with 8 large shrimp that I shared with dining companions, but I could have polished off a plate of these.  I also loved the crispy fried duck served with a congac based curry.  Again, another unique dish to me and I couldn't get enough.  We had other dishes that I can't complain about, but these two were clearly the standouts.   One thing I would mention, the spice level was not nearly as high as I assumed. We ordered "medium" and my next go round i would go high as I felt there wasn't much heat at all. That didn't take away from the fact that I really enjoyed my meal here.   Prices are very reasonable for what you get. This is a very good choice to take a break from the flashy casino dining.
77	1	The Gold Standard burger lives up to its name and more. Possibly the best burger that I have ever had in my life!  Their shakes are a fun treat as well. The Apple Pie is one of my faves, with real bits of apple, making it literally taste like they shoved an entire pie in a blender with some rum and ice cream and served it in a giant glass. Also, they give you the extras, so you're really having 2 milkshake glasses instead of one. A tiny girl like me can take one down and be content for the rest of the evening.  Here's a fun tip for you club-goers: Head to Marquee early and get your stamp. Once you're in, get your drank/dance on for a bit and then leave to go to Holsteins downstairs for a mid-club snack. When you're done, go back upstairs to Marquee's re-entry line and dance the burger/night away. Best way to spend a night in Vegas.
78	1	My wife and I have stayed in the Venetian on numerous occasions. But never have considered dining at Bouchon until recently. I would have to say... hands down... one of the best dining experiences ever. The wait staff is very and their attention to detail is superb. The food quality is excellent. For dinner i ordered the mussels entree. The mussels were cooked with saffron butter and white wine. The portion size was very filling, and it came with a huge side of  crispy delicious french fries. My wife had the flat iron steak, but instead of fries, mac n cheese was substituted. I snuck a bite of her steak, and it was tender and juicy. The "Moscow Moose" (vodka, ginger beer,  and lime) is a must have. I would come back for the Moscow Moose alone.  My wife and I are definitely coming back here, if we're in Vegas. Luckily they have a location a couple hours away.
79	1	The service was awesome; very fast, helpful, cheerful, and polite! And the food was absolutely delicious. I visited this place twice during one visit to Vegas bc I couldnt get enough of it :) My favorite was the Drunken Sea Bass, Red Curry, pork larb, and the mint duck... all reasonably priced. I know thai food and this is it, yum.
80	0	My fiance and I stopped by here and ordered from the to-go line. We ordered a pretzel which was awful. It was hard and dry. I had expected it to be warm, soft and fresh. We also ordered a frozen hot chocolate. It was expensive, not worth it, and I would rather have just gone to Starbucks and ordered a frozen drink.
81	0	Great location, atmosphere and service. But the food, the food. The food is the rub. Every meat was overcooked and dry. It's a steakhouse and I expected the signature food to be much better.  Be sure to get the coupon from the girl out front. But even at half price, it's still no bargain. Maybe try at lunch when prices are already lower.
82	1	The Egg & I has the freshest eggs you can get at a breakfast restaurant! My scrambled egg whites were fluffy, light, and delicious! Their homemade banana muffins were yummy and their fruit was fresh! The restaurant itself is quaint and adorable. And you can't beat the price (especially if you've spent the weekend shelling out tons of money for food on The Strip!) This place is definitely worth going out of your way for if you're visiting Vegas!
83	1	One of the best New York style pizzas I've ever had. This place really is a secret in that it's probably impossible to find unless you ask someone. It's down this remote corridor with no signage or anything. There was also a bit of a line, but boy the pizza was worth every minute of the wait.  The slices are a decent size and the flavor is awesome. the crust is beautifully crispy. I would eat the crust by itself as a loaf of bread. That's the secret to an awesome pizza in the first place. Add to that flavorful fresh ingredients and you have a winner.  Just an FYI - don't expect a restaurant type setting. There are a couple of bar stools, but basically it's a take it to go type of place. Again, the win is in the food itself. Really good.  I highly recommend Secret Pizza to anyone visiting the Vegas Strip.
84	1	I'm keeping this review short since there are so many to review from.  Service - 5 stars Food - 5 stars Price - 4 stars (a bit pricey but you get what you pay for so to speak)  We were recently in Vegas celebrating my boy's bachelor party.  We came in with a party of 10 and were instantly greeted and seated.  They gave us some pistachios and bread to start with.  Try the bread with a little butter and their home made mustard.  The combo sounds kinda weird, but it's killer!  To warm the taste buds, I ordered the cream of mushroom.  It was very tasty but nothing extraordinarily different.  However, for my main course, I ordered the sirloin steak sous vide with vegetables.  Mid order, I asked the waiter if I could swap the veggiies for fries.  He said, the order comes with the veggies but that he'd bring 3 baskets of fries for our group on the house.  And as for the steak, it was vacuumed sealed to capture the juices....and it definitely tasted that way.  Juiciest Sirloin ever!  Cooked to perfection and was super tasty.
85	1	This is an over the top unique restaurant..that "nails" it on almost everything....and I'm giving it yelps highest grade...but I'm not certain I'd ever return. Its almost an exhausting gastronomic experience....I walked away from here completely satisfied....very very full.....yet almost mentally drained. Its a really happening place.  Its noisy...dark..hustle-bustle. we didn't really care for the atmosphere...not relaxing at all....our table was very close to the waiters pick up station..constant commotion going on.... the food is off the charts terrific...... .Christopher,our waiter, was very very good. Knew the ins and outs of the menu. Even in the frenzied atmosphere he took the time to walk us through everything we needed to know. Drinks are robust and made perfectly. the bread is almost a meal onto itself....he explained what we were getting.....soooo good! as apps...the british ale onion soup,the blue crab soup and the Caesar salad got high grades. My wife had the fishermans grill/lobster,mussels and scallop mix and loved it. my son,daughter  and I each had the roasted beef wellington...fantastic! Christopher explained twice why we didn't want beef wellington for 2..so we each had our single portion. you can't make this at home! mac and cheese side dish was fabulous. you must save room for the sticky toffee pudding for dessert..we shared....almost puts you in a sugar induced coma. All this comes at a high price but we all left here happy. this is definitely NOT your fathers old stodgy steakhouse.
86	0	Use to love this place. Use to! Not busy Friday night and now I may know why. Ordered a filet and was tasteless. Server reordered it and had it chard. Took forever, our table was almost done eating. STILL NO FLAVOR! .......REALLY!!  This is a steak house for Pete sake. Spend some money on a salt and pepper shaker. Sister and spouse tried it too and agreed. Manager said they season with salt and pepper and are usually heavy on that, then followed up with "a filet usually has little flavor". Huh?? Asked him to try it but he refused. But just continued to argue the point but would not try it. He Just liked to continue to say I was wrong. So I was done! Sooooo done! And manager did nothing to make it right I mean NOTHING! But he got out of there quick. Maybe he was not the manager!  Just presented us with the rest of the expensive bill. So after we left our party. We went back to our hotel the Wild Horse Pass Resort so I could eat something. I was so starving since I had only bread and my husband sat and watched. REAL FUN NIGHT!!! So maybe the General Manager should call us if they care.
87	0	Ok. When you go to Las Vegas to get the hell away and have to pay for airfare as well. All I can tell you is it's old, worn, but CLEAN! I did feel as if I was stuck in circa 1978 for a few days but hey! It actually worked for the money. It's not fancy and far away from the new part of the strip so I suggest instead of paying for monorail tickets bring or rent a car!
88	1	I can't believe how great this restaurant is.  It is a gem.  We come to LV every year and my husband found this on the web and we decided to try it.  What a deal for the price.  We had lunch there.  For less than $13, you have two selections of meats, one salad or soup with one appetizer.  On top of that, we get 7 side dishes.  The portion of the salad and appetizer is huge.  How I wish they can open one in San Francisco.  I would eat there every week. You have to try it to believe it!
89	1	Ordered the meat lovers for two and a steamed egg and was very happy with everything. Had a great selection of meat and wasn't disappointed by anything- all was good quality. The bulgogi was my favorite.  I recommend the steamed egg, it was one of the best I've had. The combination also comes with a large salad which was nice. Only thing I would improve is the cucumber kimchi, which was too sweet.
90	0	Sub par restaurant. The place wasn't to full capacity, and I waited 25 mins to be seated and I had to wait 15 mins before a waiter approached my table. I had a grilled chicken salad from McDonald's better than the one I had tonight. Rolls brought to the table were not hot, but rather straight out of the refrigerator. In addition, the entire time we ate the housekeepers were vacuuming close to our table and two maintenance personnel walked past our table carrying plungers. Disgusting!!! The waiter was polite, but didn't fix the issue of my chicken breast being tough and poorly seasoned.
91	1	Once again, Hash House A Go Go is a must! I hit Hash House A Go Go on Friday for lunch. I got there a bit before noon and only had a 15 minute wait for lunch. My previous two visits were about the hash so this visit had to be about the Chicken and Waffles.   Wow, the plate, like all of their others, was huge! Two breasts with drummies and about two full waffles with the bacon cooked into the waffle. Making this to order took about 20+ minutes for it to get to the table and it was worth it. Gotta say the chicken was good, the waffle was good but as another review said - a little more syrup (okay, "Maple Syrup Reduction") would have made it a bit better.   I ate about 2/3 of the plate and gave up. I was so full I did not need to eat for the rest of the day.  This restaurant stays on my must-visit list for every time I go to Vegas.
92	0	Gave them one star because I couldn't do no stars.  The food is fairly decent, but it is not out of this world. The service is what lacks. It is not difficult to treat customers well or be up front with them to be accommodating.   We had a group of 5 and the server was extremely rude and even made comments toward us as we left.   For a town that host trade shows and borders California it is easy for us to visit Vegas often. Since my visit in January 2014 i have not returned to Serendipity 3 and do not ever plan to again.
93	1	My southern grandma passed away without sharing some of her famous recipies with the family.  This place has food that tastes just like and similar to grandma's!  The tastes of the warm biscuit (with fruit topping) and rich mashed potatos really took me back to my childhood.  The portions are HUGE, you'll probably need a to go box.  Cost is low considering the value.  The bill for two people with a 25% tip was $53.    I thought it was interesting that they don't have heat lamps, so food gets delivered to your table as it's ready.  REALLY that's how it should be, everyone gets their food as fresh as possible.  The presentation of the food is very thoughtful and the taste is rich (heavy, southern style).  Don't expect to eat for the rest of the day, you'll likely be too full! :-)  I had a mint latte here that was one of the best I have ever tasted (and I've had tons of lattes)!    Our waitress "Kai," (short hair, enthusiastic) was super nice and helpful.  We saw her stand on top of a chair to take a picture of a large party at a table- that's service!  We'll be back and likely ask to be seated in her section. :-)
94	0	Back to my Vegas trip...  We came here after walking around on the strip and aside from the place being super dark I was kind of excited to see what they had to offer.  First we must have came in the back way because I couldn't find the hostess or a server walking about.  Finally tracked one down and after some finagling we got seated upstairs.  The upstairs was nice but we didn't get a good seat to view the strip so we got tucked away in a corner which probably lead us to being ignored for a good 30 mins before we even got our drinks let alone placed our order.  I should have taken the cue to leave then.  We placed our orders and the waiter disappeared for another hour and finally brought back our food.  Seemed he was preoccupied with the lovely ladies in the other part of the restaurant.  I don't blame him, but at least check back once in a while.  We ate and left, the place was decorated well but the food was pretty mediocre.  Disappointing.
95	1	Most foodies know about the legendary Lotus of Siam in Las Vegas. All I can say is this...the curry here (specifically the Panang) is BY FAR the most exquisite Thai curry I have ever had. The nuance, the balance and subtlety of the flavors is incomparable. I've never had anything I didn't love and I've been going here for almost 15 years, but the Panang curry is truly a masterpiece of culinary excellence.
96	1	Ever since Triple D came to this restaurant, I had been dying to go. Now that I have gone...IT WAS WORTH THE WAIT!!!  -Oxtail chili cheese fries are excellent. The flavor is outrageous with all the different asian infused spices they use. -The ronin burger was great. It was juicy and worth the money.  Would I go back...HELL YEAH!!
97	0	While the entire buffet scene in Vegas have gone downhill over last few years, this one is especially BAD.    I came here to try their Sunday "Gourmet" Brunch.  Its 32.95+ tax but the it was a huge disappointment!  In Short, don't waste your money to come here.  The line was non existent when I came.  I felt it was not a good sign.  The foods were quite mediocre.  They have alot cutbacks for their brunch.  King Crabs are gone, snow crabs instead (Like Wynn).  FYI, King Crab only available on weekend dinner so I have been told. The quality of the crab is....crap.  Soggy and soft.  Lack of flavors.  Rest of the foods were non remarkable.  The presentations weren't good so did the taste of food.   Dry steaks, dry salads. Horrible Asian stations and their Italian station didn't look too good either.  Their desserts are one of their best tasting station to save this review from having 1* only.  I like their cheese cakes and apple pie but rest of them are just ...blah.  Save of your money and go somewhere else.  If you are on comp.  Try to venture other a la carte dining options in this hotel or other MGM properties.
98	0	I was SO EXCITED to try this place and I only ended up being beyond disappointed . The service was horrible and rude, the wait was long, many things were overpriced, and the frozen hot chocolate wasn't special whatsoever. Overall, this place is far over hyped and simply not worth it at all.
99	1	This place is pretty good. The food is not the best, but it's good. The buffalo chicken wraps are really tasty. The chicken parm was a bit toooo breaded, but even the lunch serving is MASSIVE. The "small salads" are huge! Just on food, I'd give this place 3.5 stars. BUT! They're 24 hours which is really nice to have a place 24 hours in the hotel and the price is right! Most places in Vegas, the pricing is at a premium, but this place? It's a deal!! Ate here 2 times with a family of four and both times got out for just about $50.
100	0	I had the worst experience ever in a las Vegas hotel! Being a local on a Thursday night I decided to try westin They serve until 6 am and I  figured it was a great place to grab a late night dinner. As I get to the bar, nobody takes my order. I struggled To get the bartenders attention, whn I did he tells me that he can't serve me and that he has been directed to call security. So I politely asked if I could speak to security. When security shows up he refused to speak to me or even look at me. He also says he can't help me, so sitting here baffled I ask to speak to a higher management. So security manager Dean comes over and again can't give me an explanation of why I can't be served all while looking me from top to bottom making me assume that he is profiling me. After I ask the reason behind this he says he cannot tell me the reason but that he as the right to refuse service. He said i am more than welcome to come back to speak to Ben noble at 9am.
101	1	Whenever I go to Vegas, I eat at the Burger Bar because of their delicious burgers and exceptional salted caramel shake.  I am even more impressed with the staff and management of the Burger Bar because I hosted my wedding reception of 21 guests there last weekend. I made reservations over a month ago so we didn't have long to wait. They arranged tables through the center of the restaurant because they don't have a private room.The service was excellent (I think the server's name was Gina) and our food arrived quickly and perfectly prepared. Thank you Burger Bar!
102	0	I have frequented the Spice Market a number of times when I  was in Las Vegas.  Every time it was excellent probably the best in the city.  I took a party of 9 today for breakfast, spending over $180 only to find the quality had fallen off significantly.  As examples, the cheese on the cheese platter was dry and the edges curling.  The baked oatmeal was so over cooked that you could not get a serving spoon to break the  crust.  The bowl of compote at the crepe station were very unappetizing.  In fact the bananas foster with peaches resembled vomit.  I infact spoke to the manager, Keith, and his.attitude was that he could care less and did missed my comments.  Save your money and find another breakfast buffet.  This review should actually have 1star but the attitude of the waitstaff was excellent.  The only.redeeming feature of this Buffett.
103	1	If I could give 6 stars, i would.  I had heard about this place for over a year from co-workers who travel to Vegas regularly.  I get my share of Vegas as well but this place is about 6 miles away from the strip and I hear it's a pain to get a cab back.  So it's taken me nearly a year to try this place, but i'm glad i finally made it!  Enough storytelling, time for the good stuff.  Bachi Burger puts an Asian spin of the traditional burger and combines some of the things you love in Asian cooking into a sandwich.  Our goal was to try as many of the burgers as we could as there were three of us.  First, great beer selection here!  We started off with the oxtail chili cheese fries and it was a perfect side option for 3 people.  Comes with an egg on top.  The yolk mixed in with the chili and cheese is just the right amount of gooey goodness.  Again the goal was to try as many burgers as we can so we each decided to get something unique and promised to eat one half and split the other half into two so we can all get a taste of each other's.  This was a brilliant idea and I recommend you all try this if going as a group.  Burger # 1: Miyagi Burger - It's their signature burger and comes with grass fed kobe beef patty, some sort of amazing sauce, fried egg and onion strings.  Amazing texture and taste Burger # 2: Spicy Miso: Simple with an amazing spicy sauce that provides just the right amount of heat. This was my favorite! Burger # 3: Unagi Burger:  This one costs $24 but it's well worth the price.  It was a little too sweet and rich for my taste but def worth a try  So after all this we sat there.  Our stomachs were full but we still wanted to end with a bang. The debate was if we wanted dessert, and if so which ones.  Except I had another brilliant idea and recommended we get another burger and split it in three.  I think we were all thinking the same thing, I was brave enough to say it.  So we sat and wondered what else are we going to go with.  Our wonderful server recommended the Mr. Hong, since it was different than what we had already tried.  And what a great recommendation it was!    So like I said, in the beginning, I'd give this place 6 starts if I could.  Not only was the food great, our server made sure we were taken care of from the moment we walked in.  I'm making Bachi Burger my go to destination every time I visit Vegas.
104	0	OK I have as good of a sense of humor as the next guy. Probably better. But this place just plain rubbed me the wrong way.   I understand the premise of the place, staff treating you like garbage and you're supposed to laugh it off as part of the charm, but for real, you gotta draw a fuckin line somewhere.  My story: A friend and I came here to grab a drink and we see a bunch of people wearin these weird paper hats with things like "asshole" and other insulting shit like that written on them. I won't write what some of 'em say because they were just plain gross (especially for a place that serves food), again, understand where the line is.   So I start talking to one of the bartender chicks and she tells me the hats are insults that they label individually and, in one of the most twisted compliments (may have been a pass, I really don't fuckin know or care to know for that matter) I've ever had heaved at me in my life. She says to me "like if I was to make a hat for you it would say 'You're not worth the AIDS I'll get," I really couldn't believe she had the gall to say that, but I managed to maintain my cool and dish it right back to her saying "right on, so if I was gonna make one for you it'd say 'titties in progress' right?" then just turned around and walked away.   I'm not HIV positive or have AIDS but can you fucking imagine, if I did, the lawsuit I could file against this place?!?!? Also if I did, that would just not be in the most poorest of tastes to say. Even for a place like this.  Anyways the moral of the story is, know when to draw a line if you're gonna run this type of joint because it's a pretty slippery fuckin slope and shit could get real bad throwing words like that around.
105	1	Wake me up before you Go Go because I'm not planning on going solo.  Hash House is amazazing. For all you "What Would You Do?" fans, the Hash House served as a backdrop for many of their scenarios. More famously, they are known for being on Man vs. Food. And unless you have an appetite like Adam Richman, I suggest you bring a friend to help you eat the madness that is "Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Hash House Farm Benedict." It is to die for! Chipotle cream with peppers, scrambled eggs, griddled mozzarella, fried chicken, bacon, market tomato, spinach, and biscuit on top of griddled potatoes. This is literally the best breakfast I ate in Vegas. If you're a fan of country fried chicken, this is right up your alley. MUST. EAT. NOW. Check out my photos if you need inspiration.
106	0	DISGUSTING!  After waiting for an hour, we finally arrived near the end of the line where I can grab my strawberry soda. After paying my cheap admission price of ~$12, I was eager to start my dinner with hopes it would be decent given all the hype.   10 minutes later, I ate raw canned corn which were half cooked, a piece of steak that was rock solid when suppose to be medium rare, chow mein which tastes far from even mein, and lukewarm broccoli. It made me really appreciate the other bad buffets I have been too. This is by far the worst buffet I have been to.   The floor was grossly dirty. Pieces of bread and meat lingered all over. Parents were letting their kids roam free, dropping ice cream and strawberries. I even saw a kid pick his booger out before using the same hand to grab a corn on the cob. Needless to say, I lost my hungry appetite FAST.   The salad bar was not any better. The lettuce was not in cold temperature. The dessert section was mediocre with plain peach cobblers. Not worth the drive. Now worth the wait. Not worth the price. Just not worth it at all.
107	0	I ate here yesterday and the cottage cheese was spoiled! I have never tasted such bitter and sour cottage cheese. Someone could seriously get sick from eating spoiled dairy products. It's very serious that the buffet is not checking their products and looking out for the safety of their guests. I was so disgusted I will never be back to the buffet and because of this experience I definitely will not choose to stay at this hotel. If they put spoiled cottage cheese on the buffet I would hate to see the quality of the rooms. Overall just a very nasty and awful experience.
108	1	We're from Los Angeles - on vacation. The wait wasn't as long as we had expected - but a much longer wait would've been worth it! Liza was super attentive, friendly, & warm. We highly recommend this place to anyone in Las Vegas area. We had Mimosas, stuffed French Toast, & the Works Chili Skillet; simply the best!!!
109	0	Upon exiting, I look for the Riviera Casino and Hotel. It appears that our GPS is guiding us to the slums. Moments, we are driving to a very old section of Las Vegas. I don't mind that classic feel, but when it's no longer maintained and businesses appear to be gone as well, it's quite depressing.  Arrival to the Riviera... .... ....  I've driven over 4 hours to arrive to a line with at least 50 people, so I'm sorta expecting a fun and entertaining counter to get my mood swinging UP! Check-in counter employees do not appear happy or mad, but they are quite depressing to deal with. They seem to be sick of their job.   I will never reserve a room here again. It is bad. My non-smoking room smelled so bad, I felt healthier breathing in the casino floor and/or hallways! The AC couldn't be adjusted to be comfortable, so it was either blistering cold A/C or hot HEAT. The unit didn't seem to be drawing fresh air either. The standard room's bathroom is small, and I couldn't hang my towels because the hanging mounts were all broken. The toilet barely flushes. The sink water has strong pressure, at least. The 1950's had it very well, but they can no longer compete with casinos on the strip. I would book Circus Circus before giving this place another shot.  I should have snapped a picture of the air filter (they actually have one!!) located inside our room. Last I checked, filters are meant to be replaced, not in continuous service while the white filter media is BLACK!!!!!!!!!  Why did I book this? It was the cheapest rate at the time (still above $120). However, it is off the strip, very depressing, and just not a place to dwell. The casino floors, however, was active and appears OK. They had one (1) Pai Gow table on a Saturday (9th) November, and people playing that night (8PM to 4AM Sunday) all received a FAT 5-ACES bonus for betting on the ENVY. 4 players received $1,000, and the 5-ACES hand landed on the Dragon Hand.  You would not believe the PIT BOSSES faces. They made us feel that we didn't deserve to win. They scrutinized the dealer at the time of win, and came back to ask more questions 3 hours later (after shift rotation)! Unfortunately, they weren't expecting to payout that much on a single Pai Gow table and it was clear that they were hurting that night.   At the cashier, I was asked "where did you win all this money"? I mean they were all on high alert since the table payout was $4,000 in bonus payout, and many bonuses throughout the period.  I will never stay here again, but  I would play at their casino floor, hoping for another good bonus flop!
110	1	One bite the Rising Sun Burger and you're in beef nirvana.  And one bite is all I got, because my dinner companion, AKA significant other, wouldn't share after that.  But that's ok, although my Longhorn burger wasn't as good, it's no flakeout in the burger department.  Just not as exotic an explosion in your mouth as the traditional Japanese flavors that are perfectly introduced into the western standard that is the burger on a bun called, once again, The Rising Sun.  And let me tell you, this burger planetarian will now orbit around this fabulous burger.  The beers are nice and cold and that's what I reverted to after an uber strong margarita on the rocks.  I treated it like a shot, cause at $14 there's no way I'd leave it sitting on the table.  We were seated immediately, the service was fast, extremely friendly and ready to answer any questions we had about the menu.  I can't wait to go back, and guess what I'll be ordering next time?  Hai, The Rising Sun.  Arigato Holsteins!!!
111	0	Not impressed. Evening dinner before a show on 1 Oct 16.  Very poor start with reservations running behind.  When we were seated 10 minutes behind our time there were plenty of seats available. Some tables had things others did not even the basics like salt and pepper.  I looked over the salad bar while waiting on the server and it was not worth the effort. We ordered the drinks and the meal immediately since we had the time to read the menu ahead and the drinks showed up 5 minutes behind the meal. (15 minutes). the meal was prepared well but the serving size to cost was poor (almost twice what I would pay elsewhere for a filet mignon). Our server was slow on checking on drink refills and even slower handling the check. They were using a tablet system to order (supposedly for the first night) and finalize the checks but watching him the receipt printers were a challenge.  The restaurant itself looked satisfactory as far as decor but the bathroom was undersized for a restaurant of that style where people are going to stay and eat a while for their money.  I am certain we could find a better place on the strip.
112	1	Everytime I'm in Vegas I have to eat here. I always order the farm burger and the jalapeo poppers this this is the second time I have the hod burger and first time was good but plain. They now made it much better and now preffered over the farm burger. Not comes with jog patty, hog bacon and hog bbq pulled hog with so much melty cheese
113	1	Don't know what to order? Get the Rising Sun burger. The most delicious burger ever. Perfect combination of richness, sweetness, and savoriness. Words cannot explain how wonderful tasting this burger is. The burger consists of Kobe beef, teriyaki glaze, nori furikake, crispy yam, spicy mayo, and tempura avocado. Burger comes with fries as well.  Definitely a little on the pricy side. The burger was $18, I believe but it was definitely worth it. Really good quality and something to try at least once if you're in Vegas!
114	0	When it comes to Lee's Sandwiches, I'll guess the answer is I'll have to come back in a few months to see if they're doing anything differently.    Unlike a few other Yelpers who have had a Lee's Sandwich experience before, I've never been to this chain and really wanted to go as soon as they opened.  I really like banh mi and wanted to see if this place stacked up to other local establishments.  Unfortunately the service was super slow (perhaps due to being relatively new) and the sandwiches were not up to par.  I found them to be REALLY skimpy on the toppings as there were quite a few bites of my charbroiled pork sandwich that consisted of just bread and pickled carrots. I brought a bunch of friends with me to try it out and their sandwiches were equally..."empty".  I hope they understand that my desire to go to Lee's was to try them for the first time and not to show them a great place to eat.  As with some other places to eat here in Vegas, Lee's seems to be one of those places that is good just because it's open.  The quality is not there, we experienced really slow service and the sandwiches are skimpy.  I like the baguettes but there are better if I'm willing to drive to them.   Overall, not the best, but something to eat if you need to soak up some alcohol after a night of going out.  As I'm a cab driver, I'll probably never go there for that reason so I guess I'll go back in about 6 months to see if they've gotten any better.   Before I forget, it seems that Lee's has an abundance of ice as their drinks (coffee, iced tea or soft drinks) are mostly ice.  Make sure you don't get thirsty here as their drinks are mostly comprised of ice and you could end up spending a fortune to quench your thirst!  Maybe that will make the sandwiches seem like a better deal?
115	1	I'm not all that crazy about spending $13-$20 on a burger, however, with that said, this place had a pretty darn good burger.  I got the buffalo burger and it was awesome.  I'd still rather go to the Apple Pan in Los Angeles, but this place is definitely up there. I was especially happy with the hostess.  There was a 40 minute wait when we got there.  We didn't want to wait so our party sat and ordered at a few open seats the bar had.  We saw a few tables open up about 10 minutes later and no one sat at those tables.  I asked the hostess if we could sit there and she initially told me that if we had already ordered at the bar we had to stay and eat there..house rules.  She then went to talk to her manager and in a few minutes we were in a booth.  what more can I say than...Niiiiiice!
116	1	This was my second visit and I was just as pleased as the first.  We found Lotus of Siam via a new acquaintance last time we were in Vegas.  We were unable to get a reservation (the history on my phone shows 27 attempted calls, all of which received a busy signal), so we showed up at 5:20 on a Friday night.  They open at 5:30, and we were not the first in line.  We walked in right after the door opened, got a great table, and enjoyed a fabulous meal and glass of wine.    I am gluten-free, and have been pleased that they will accommodate different preparations of certain dishes to meet that dietary need.    Their wine list is impressive, and not ridiculously overpriced.  When we left a little after 6:30 every table was full, the vestibule was packed, and several diners were waiting outside (yes, in the skeezy strip mall).  The moral of the story is that this place is worth the stop, even at what many would consider the "Senior" dining hour.
117	0	Got a groupon deal here for a really cheap room for the weekend. Room was whatever, kind of big, got a free bottle of wine so that was cool.   Not cool part?   they charged me for outgoing long distance phone calls to a phone number that nobody in my HUGE GROUP OF 2 even has in our phones, and they said someone called out from our room around 1 am. REALLY??? #1, both of us have cell phones, why the F would we use your stupid landline. #2, 100% sure I was at XS during that time dancing what's left of my youth away.   DO NOT STAY HERE!!!!! SHADY SHADY SHADY
118	0	This has to rate as bad as the Stratosphere buffet, only worse because at least at Stratosphere someone will get you a soda, a refill, and clean up the area around your table.   I was so hungry and didn't feel like walking back to Mirage or Treasure Island, both of which have great food, excellent service, and reasonable prices. So in  a rush to get some food I settled for Flavors. Wow! What a mistake.   Upon walking up to the cashier to pay for my meal, all three cashier continued their conversation, looking at me, saying nothing to me, and talking for over 2 minutes. Finally I said "can I pay here to eat in this buffet" and they looked at me liked I had stolen their kid. Isn't the cashier at the buffet suppose to take your money. And from here it only gets worse.  The hostess seats me at table next to a 80 year old man that has no respect for the space around him, or himself. The piled plates, the newspapers scattered around his table, and the booth on both side of him covered in his thrown about newspapers. The hostess tells me to sit and leaves all the newspaper on my seat. I looked at her like she was crazy and she pushed the papers slightly for my butt to have a clear space.   From here... oh god, the food is disgusting. Fat and grizzle in the roast beef so bad you can't chew it. Old crusted over foods, and empty containers of food everywhere.   After I sit down and eat my food I finish my soda, I say to the waitress can you please get me a diet coke and water. She snaps back..."this isn't my section, I am off." Now she is clearing tables, and is dressed like all the other servers, and she is the only one in my area. So I say.."can you please find the person who is working I would like a diet coke and water." She says, "let me see what I can do."  A trip to get a wilted salad and over 10 minutes later I still have no soda. So I ask to see the manager. This buffet was $28. I have no problem with paying $28 to get a decent meal and decent service. Flavors is far from decent anything. Stay away it's a dump.
119	0	So a vegetarian walks into a burger joint.... But seriously, my two partners wanted burgers and this place boasted a veggie burger, so I was sold! Result? Food was good! I did the Inferno Burger with a black bean patty (skip the warm lettuce) and add onion strings. It was yummy, good kick of spice and the patty was charred to perfection, just enough to crispiness. My boyfriend fell in love with the bacon & eggs sliders. He called the mini quail eggs cute- and devoured them. My BFF had the Dante with a turkey patty and loved it- especially the blue cheese. Bad news though!! Service was bad, bad, bad. They need to look at their staffing plans- our server was swamped with too many tables! She was filling drink orders, ringing up checks and helping at least 6 tables; meanwhile, 2 hosts were standing around doing nothing. At least 4 guys were bussing tables and done, standing around with nothing to do. There were at least 4 bartenders, yet they were all standing together taking. My drink never came, and we had no utensils while our food sat at our table. The saving grace was how nice and apologetic our server was!
120	1	I went for lunch. I got a pesto scramble and I have to say this was one of the best flavor combinations I've had in a while. There were eggs, pesto, whole spinach leaves, cheese, and I think some tomatoes scrabbled to fluffy perfection.  My fianc got the western omelette and he said it was the best he's ever had.   We bought a groupon at $24 for $40 worth of food so it was a good deal too, but I am definitely coming back in the future.
121	1	A perfect bite after a night of drinking and dancing, enough to soak up the alcohol and slap you back to sobriety.   My BFF and I decided to play a round of pool after the club and after hustling it from several unsuspecting men, treated ourselves to pizza. From what I can remember at 4am, the place wasn't marked with obvious signs of house made pizzas. But what was vivid was kicking off our heels, putting our feet up and enjoying my glorious cheese pizza- with extra money in our purses.
122	0	This hotel like all the others need to STOP CATERING TO SMOKERS PLEASE. If you truly enjoy breathing second-hand smoke while gambling, walking through the casino/hotel, eating, etc. then this is the place for you. It was really hard for me to like this place. The rooms are average. They charge to even drink the water which is really sad. This was my last stay here.
123	1	Located in Planet Hollywood, Gordon Ramsay Burgr can be found near the front entrance to the right of the Miracle Mile Shop entrance.  There were only 2 in my group, so the wait was not too long.  I'd imagine a larger group would have a longer wait, especially during a peak time.  I had already planned to order fries and a burger.  My waitress told me that the burgers can sometimes take a while to cook, so she suggested that I have my fries come out first so I'd have something to munch on.  Worked for me, but something to note in case you're sensitive about that type of thing.  If you order the sweet potato fries, go ahead and tell your server that you're going to need an extra serving of the honey jalapeno mayo that comes with it.  That stuff alone could get 5 stars.  It is so good.  Also, the order of fries was large enough to share between two people.  For my burger, I ordered the Farm Burger.  It's served with cheddar, duck breast bacon and a fried egg.  In case you missed that, I said duck breast bacon.  This was a delicious burger.    One helpful piece of info, if you are a Total Rewards member and show your card, you can get special pricing that comes out to a $1 off several items.  It's free to join at the Total Rewards desk found in the casino.
124	1	This was hands-down the best food I've ever eaten. Had the pork belly appetizer, fresh oysters (I'm an oyster connoisseur...these are the best, FRESHEST I've ever eaten) beef wellington, and seafood plate (can't remember the actual name of the dish.)  Drinks were fabulous. Portions were perfect. Oh, and the dessert! Sticky pudding is to die for. Eating here was an awesome experience...in itself worth the trip.
125	1	Awesome burger! The prices are well worth it! Fresh and delicious. I ordered the blue cheese burger and it was to die for. The truffle fries are also delicious and will feed up to 4 people. We also ordered the pork belly steamed buns and OMG! Must try this place and will definitely go again!
126	0	I recently made a huge mistake and stayed four nights at the LV Hilton. I used some of my HiltonHonors points for the stay. The room I was in was nothing like the website pics reflected. It was absolutely filthy. One of the light fixtures was broken. There was an upholstered chair in the room that had some white stuff running down the front that had dried. (You guess on that one)   The bed was the most uncomfortable bed I have ever slept on. It felt like metal springs with a thin skin of fabric wrapped around them.   Most of the restaurants have closed up. The Italian restaurant was only open fri and sat night. The coffee shop closes from 2-5 pm daily.  If you have a late lunch at this hotel, you will eat off of plastic.   The casino floor is filthy and desperate need of renovation. The pool area was dirty and in need of a few plants.  It is hot and windy and not very pleasant.   I will never stay at this hotel and would not recommend it. I have sent a letter to HiltonHonors requesting my points be refunded.  No matter how good the deal is they offer, don't stay here.  You will not be pleased.  After four nights here I checked out and was able to get a nice room at the Palazzo for the remainder of the week.
127	1	I am still salivating over the delicious meal I had here!    Starters: my 3 college buddies and I shared the beer battered maui onion rings (the best onion rings I've ever had) along with the truffle parmesan fries.  The portions were so generous we didn't even finish them!   Milkshake: I didn't even know pudding on top of a milkshake could be a thing but oh boy does it take this icy treat to the next level!  I opted for Shake #4 (crme brle pudding + oreo shake + oreo cookie) and it was so delicious that I inhaled it in record time.  It was one of those genius concoctions in which I wish it was in a bottomless glass.  Word of advice: use the large straw they give as a way to scoop up every last drip of pudding   Burger: I've had so many incredible burgers from the East to the West Coast that I wasn't expecting to be as blown away by the Hell's Kitchen Burger as I was! They grind the patty blend onsite and this leads to the most flavorful and juicy burger you could ever imagine.  Add in the asadero cheese, roasted jalapeo peppers, avocado, and oven roasted tomato and you have one of the most flavorful culinary experiences of all-time.
128	0	Other than the hella hyped up frozen hot chocolate, this place is mediocre at best. I ordered the chicken tenders appetizer with 3 dipping sauces. And I swear, the chicken tasted like paper. It only tasted okay when I dipped it in a sauce. I didn't even wanna eat it after I got a box for it and brought it with me back to my hotel.   The next day, I went back again before the end of my trip. I ordered the chili since I was starting to feel sick from the whole weekend. After eating half of the bowl, I couldn't finish it because it was so spicy. It was very good though, since it had filet mignon chunks in it. But the spice was just too overwhelming.   Next time, I'll just have the frozen hot chocolate and that's it. I'm done giving their food more chances, only to be let down on more than one occasion.
129	0	Avoid. Used to be good. They wont steam the crab legs for you unless you're a VIP member. Guess my $30 isn't good enough for them, yours probably isn't either. Go elsewhere, don't be left with a bad taste in your mouth. The food selections are hit and miss. Scampi, prime rib, sausage n peppers, fajitas and guacamole is ok. Bunch of other stuff not so great. Service is questionable. They only pick up dirty plates-eventually. You have to get your own drinks. No purified water, just tap.
130	0	I guess memorial day weekend was not a good time for tao. Everyone was pissed because we were all there to see Kaskade who didn't even come on until 2. it was supposed to be a 6 hour set and along with that all of the employees kept saying he was coming on at 1. Maybe it would be better to go on a not so popular weekend. I literally couldn't even walk without being seriously scared that I was going to die by stampede. Other than that the decor was cool and if you eat at the restaurant girls are free and guys are half off. It was alright...

The weather is hot so I gamble that I can get a table at the bar between 5 and 6. Bar tables do not require a reservation. I show at 5:30 and there is a premium table available. Yes, call this 'Money Won.' and is twice as sweet.  Immediately capturing your attention is an eye-catching, restaurant-wide Union Jack ceiling mural and custom neon sculpture. I also notice a second level up high with table service.

132	1	I'll keep it short. As with most things in Vegas, you get what you pay for. Try the shell fish appetizer- it has a high price tag for an appetizer but you won't have a better variety of fresh seafood presented to you better than this. The wagyu beef skirt steak (like most American wagyu, this wasn't real wagyu, but an incredibly close offering) was incredible! The beef Wellington was good except the dough fell off the steak because the knives weren't serrated to cut clean through. They don't do serrated knives because they claim it tears the meat. Disagree with that but that's ok. Overall great restaurant and you might get a chance to see a celebrity chef at work.
133	1	Hidden little gem in Cosmopolitan hotel! This place has no signs, and they do not advertise it. It's one of those... if you know about it type of thing. Funny thing is, I learned about Secret Pizza in an airplane, and knew I just had to try it for myself.  It's tucked away in a little hallway, full of people who just got done clubbing. I guess some can easily say it's drunk people food. Absolutely not!! I believe they do not advertise it because it is "Secret Pizza" after all.. I think this place would appeal more to the young adults. There are no actual tables, and just a little bar counter with a few stools and chairs... maybe five? There wasn't really a place to eat, and it would have been pretty awkward to eat there while the line of people stare at you because of the way it was arranged. I recommend getting take-out! Long line, but they do try to get you out of there as quickly as possible. The crust is extremely thin I assume so it can cook much quicker, some of the veggies are pre-cooked in advance, and the mushroom is sliced paper thin to reduce cooking time.  I've eaten pizza from here at least 10 times, and I think it's safe to say it's my absolute favorite pizza joint!   The pizza is delicious! I think it's one of the best one's I've ever had. I still crave it...... WHYYYY do you have to be sooo far away!?!? Well I think only in vegas will I be willing to cough up $40ish for my pizza. Worth every penny though!! The slices are very big, and they are pretty generous with their toppings. I ate at almost every eatery/ restaurant in Cosmo, and I must say, this place was my favorite! I had to eat here twice, and still craved for more!! The menu is literately typed and printed on normal computer paper. The cover of the menu simply says "Pizza"  I ordered a Five Toppings "Pie"  $29.00 -18 inches, 10 slices. Each Additional topping was $2.25 Toppings Pepperoni Sliced Sausage - Yum! Meatballs Roasted Tomatoes Fresh Garlic- Added a very nice touch Green Peppers Mushrooms-sliced so paper thin to reduce cook time..almost couldn't taste it! ): Onions Ricotta  Overall, I can't wait to go back!! I would highly recommend this place, enjoy!!!
134	1	Little gem away from the strip.  Very creative and mouth watering burgers. Ok, the fries are amazing too.  We got the truffle fries and the chili fries.  Both are super tasty. The black and green burger,  the Kiki burger and the regular bacon cheese burger were out of this world!  The blending of the flavors and the quality of the craftsmanship elevated these burgers to a new high. I'm not even done with lunch that I'm completing this review. Amazing experience and absolutely delicious food.
135	0	Was craving a frozen hot chocolate all week long prior to going to Vegas, so I walked down here after doing a bit of shopping at the Forum shops. Seeing as how I was ONLY gonna get a frozen hot chocolate, I went to the line outside and thought, oh, this is going to move fast cuz there's only 4 people in front of me.   Waiting  Waiting  Waiting  Waiting  20 min later, I finally get to the front of the line. SLOWEST MOVING LINE EVER! Why do they not have more people working here when the line moves at the speed of molasses. My grandma can do cartwheels faster.   Anywhoo, after paying a ridiculous $10 and waiting over 20 min, i finally had my meh frozen hot chocolate. Wasn't as good as the first time I had it. I feel sorry for the people who were waiting behind me in the growing line.
136	1	Tropical cocktails in colored pictures and in massive glass globes, pink neons lights cast strange shadows on the faux foliage, gilded mirrors makes the room look like a ballroom while the cocktail servers, clad in floor-length ball gowns and soft sex voices, sashay around the bubbling fire pit.   Strange place. But yes, I still take every one of my out-of-town friends here. Every single one.
137	1	The ambiance sells this place. Old school Vegas lives here. Reason enough to visit.  The lounge is a great place. Sit around the fire in water and enjoy the blue neon glow. Wait staff varies. I have been to this place many time spanning 2 decades. I love the joint but the waitresses are hit and miss. Often a miss. My recent visit she was pretty slow both speed and on the uptake. Bartender is good though and again, the place is just cool to visit.   Restaurant side is also a visual splendor. Food is "OK". Edible but you are not going to leave saying "wow great food". Unless all you care about is portion which 90% of the tourists seem to fall into (large eating large).   I would tell anyone to visit both restaurant and lounge side for an experience the rest of Vegas has lost. Great date spot.  For movie buffs the scene in Casino were Sam and Ginger are sitting having a drink and she returns to be asked "any change" ... that's the Peppermill lounge.
138	0	On our 3 day streak eating buffet (we've been to Bellagio, Mirage, and Wynn for dinner/lunch), Aria buffet was the worst quality of foods, and unbelievably unfriendly staff off all hotels. Fail expectations for the price.   Rancid shrimp dumpling (Har gow), so bad I spit it out. Shrimp cocktail that still has its shell unremoved. Oysters were fishy and sloppy, a sign that expired. Cold king crags legs that were overcooked. People went through them because a. Lot of them were just undesirable and people picked all over them leaving only scraps. Nothing remarkable.  Esther showed us to our table. She failed to let us in after we had walked to check out the food, only to tell us to go back to end of line, no exception. She unwilling to make better of the situation by letting us use mlife line.  Staff only care about their responsibilities and won't call server too come to you, even though ours was no where to be found.  Don't go here for buffet. Terrible food terrible service.  Tip: go to Wynn for best flood Best service.
139	1	While I'm usually a traditionalist and love my prawns with heads on, tentacles flailing, and beady eyes glaring at me,* I am willing to give Lotus a little hug...because if you take fat, juicy shrimp, glaze them with some sweet and hot sauce wrap them in bacon and fry them until the bacon is crisp and the juices from the bottom dweller are oozing about, you've got yourself an amazing dish that should never be passed up. I don't care how (in)authentic an appetizer it is, as long as it screams CRASH BANG BOOM in my mouth, that's all that really matters.   And then there's the vegetable dish complete with various stir fried vegetables that seems as though they've been sitting in a vat of chili oil for years. They're spicy, juicy and perfect. The pepper seeds through the dish let you know that this is a Thai serious dish and you better damn well order sticky rice to offset some of that fire ferocity.   Lotus. A flow. A sweet, pretty pink flower. So innocent. So harmless. Has turned my mouth into a raving lunatic. I want to go back to Vegas...but not for the grand casinos and the sexy showgirls, but for the bacon wrapped shrimp and an entree so unbelievably piquant that I'll have to return...to know that the Lotus wasn't just a mirage.   *Kidding. I hate things with heads.
140	1	This is our special occasion restaurant even though it's not too fancy. It's kind of in the ghetto, but it is so worth the drive.  Everything I have ever had here is fantastic.  Not sure what it's called on the menu, but the crispy prawns with their heads are super yummy... and the drunken noodles, nam kao tod, tom kah kai soup, coconut ice cream which seems like it is home made, sticky rice dessert, etc. are all unbelievable.  Oh I can't forget and my new fave green papaya salad...so nummy!
141	1	The Egg & I has got to be the best breakfast dining experience I've had in Vegas. The place is busy because the food is excellent for a really good price and the service is very good.  Food: 1) Banana Nut Muffin was the best I've ever tried so far. You could tell they used a lot of butter because it was so soft and flavorful! 2) Benedict - The eggs were poached perfectly and the hollandaise sauce was amazing. Perfect execution of this dish. 3) Ranch potatoes were FANTASTIC. They were seasoned perfectly and not overly salty. They didn't have that heavy, thick potato texture. It was lightly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  Service: The hostesses knew how to handle the influx of people waiting and the servers were friendly, helpful, and very efficient. We even got water refills without even having to ask.
142	0	I wanted to love this restaurant..., I truly did because I heard Jose Andres was the Chef owner and as a DC resident I love anything Jose Andres!! One night my girl friends got take out after a long day of partying but her sister is a foodie so the fact she said her Seafood noodle dish didn't have lobster and it's $50 and then  said her food was  not  good, I became  worried because I was really excited about eating there. So Saturday after a long day at A Cedric Gervais pool party, hungover and starving we went to eat here and the food was not good at all. It was salty it tasted like MSG and I felt sick after my meal. I wouldn't be too excited to eat here again . Sooooo Disappointed :/
143	1	This place immediately ranked in my top 10 restaurants list. The concept is cool - burger and milkshake bar - and the create-your-own burger is a great touch. What is more Vegas than the option to make your own burger and top it with a lobster tail or just have a plain ol' cheeseburger? This is what I love about Vegas, culinary free reign in every shape and size at every price point. Viva!  I had a turkey burger with caramelized veggies, a side of fries, and a Nutella milkshake. Talk about heaven! The flavors were great, quality was very good, prices were fair, service was attentive, and just an all around great lunch. I would go back in a heartbeat!
144	0	one word - OVERRATED!  The fam bamz decided to come here for an afternoon snack.  We heard about the rave of the "Frozen Hot Chocolate" and wanted to find out what the hype was all about.  It was around 3pm and to be expected, the place was mad busy.  There was an hour and 1/2 wait for a party of 8.  There was plenty of outdoor tables and the weather was absolutely phenomenal during the month of March. We decided to try out their take out orders.  It's a limited menu but again, we were there strictly for dessert.  We were in line for 45 minutes.  I don't understand why there was a long wait when the orders consisted of ice cream.  I passed on the frozen hot chocolate - why do I need to spend $15 on a milkshake?  I went with the huge chocolate donut and the Forbidden Sundae which consisted of chocolate cake, chocolate and vanilla cream, whip cream, chocolate syrup, and a cherry on top.  I waited another 15 minutes for my order to be prepared.  I saw my sundae sitting on the counter underneath an air vent that was melting my ice cream. It took another 10 minutes for the server to grab my donut.  By the time I was handed my sundae, the whip cream turned into milk and spilled over the cheesy cup.  The cake was hard and chewy.  The ice cream underneath and had already turned into mush.  It was the MESSIEST sundae I have ever dealt with.  It was sooo messy, that it got me angry and I just wanted to throw it away! The donut was nothing special....just  big.  This was the worst experience ever! Everyone wants to eat here because of the movie; well, I'm hear to tell you that the service and food is below standard!  WASTE OF MONEY AND TIME!  If you want real ice cream, come over to the bay area and hit up MITCHELL'S!  Mitchell's is worth standing in line for!
145	0	I'm about to go on a Vegas binge sometime soon, this review was supposed to come earlier but I've been busy this whole year! Anyways, I digress, here are some quick tips:  1. At time of writing, Bayside Buffet does still have discounts through MyVegas the facebook/iphone app.   2. Strategic timing is key. If you come at 10:45 AM for Breakfast M-F, you can get in for $17.99 and then stay for lunch when it's bumped up to $21.99. This is just common Vegas buffet savvy though! However, this DOES NOT work for dinner as it does start at 4:30 PM regardless of the day.  3. Brunch begins at 7:00-2:30 on Saturdays/Sundays.   We rolled in on a lazy Saturday afternoon around 1:00 PM towards the tail end of brunch. We knew that there might be a lot of people waiting to get in, but we weren't prepared to see that the line was pretty much completely empty. Regardless, we walked up presented our MyVegas discount to get in for 2 for 1 without problems, and then walked up to the buffet.  I remember around twelve years back heading to the Bayside for the best crab and the best desserts on the strip. A lot has changed for the worse. It seemed as though almost everything that we had was either lukewarm or cold. Even things that were supposed to be under heat lamps were still cold!  Still, being hungry, we decided to sample what they had to offer. I picked up various pieces of meat from the grill, some italian dishes, and tried their sushi. One of the things I figured out quickly was their was really low quality and the steaks that they had were mostly tasteless and full of gristle.  Furthermore, the pasta sauces were watered down and the sushi was a complete utter joke. Then again, sushi at Vegas buffets are usually not really top notch at all, but this was just seaweed covered disgusting, cold, and hard rice.  The dessert section was not any better. Most of the stuff was melting and leftover chocolate streaks from stuff already taken by other guests was all over the plates. Most places at least replace the plates that food was taken off of.  Anyways, what upset my girlfriend and I the most was one particular dish. There was a baked rolled up piece of salmon that seemed like it was going to be hot. As I cut into it and opened it up, I discovered that the inside seemed to be raw. Note, this was not some sort of fancy salmon tartar or salmon sashimi, this was supposed to be a baked piece of salmon that was fully cooked.   Anyways, I notified the waiter who promised to talk to the chef. I watched this interaction to see what would happen. The chef talked with the waiter, looked at the fish, set it down, and went back to laughing and talking to another coworker. The waiter came back and told me that the chef said it was cooked, but when I asked for the waiter's opinion he told me he wouldn't have eaten it because it looked raw.   At this point, I asked for a manager. I couldn't believe that the chef would be so careless with his guests. If he truly believed that the fish was cooked, then he should have come back and served that piece of fish to me. Instead, he didn't even come to hear my feedback or anything. Anyways, the manager chewed out the chef, took note that really almost everything was cold, and also comped our meal. So props to the manager who deserves 5 stars, but the rest of the buffet deserves 0 stars.  I would not come back to the Bayside Buffet, but perhaps your experience will be better! Best of luck to you all! :)
146	1	Ordered the "Las Vegas" dinner for two, was worried it wouldn't be enough food for two but we were completely wrong, it was more than enough, essentially a sampler of an array of meats and side dishes they offer. Everything was absolutely delicious, steak, prawns, chicken, all the meat was very tender and you grill it yourself, great service.
147	1	Every time I come to Vegas this place is a must. The servers are very sweet (shout out to Jessica, our amazing server, who told us to go for the waffle with strawberries and cream - it was amazing and fluffy and warm and oh man. Miss it already. Sigh) and their little egg notification for need something/satisfied) is adorable. Go. You won't regret it.  Get the skillet. Their potatoes are SO GOOD.   Check in for their free banana nut muffin. It's also SO GOOD.   What are you waiting for? Go!!!
148	1	I came here specifically for the Urth Burger with no intention to even glance at the milkshake section of the menu. But somehow my eyes were caught by the words "Guava Float."  Damn, that sounds good. Skyy Citrus Vodka, house-made guava soda, coconut sorbet, pink bubble sugar, completely dairy-free! I just had to order it. Damn... http://su.pr/1OTBxJ  Sipping on this fruity paradise made the atmosphere a little more tolerable. You see, I had flown into Vegas early that morning, spent most of the afternoon walking all around the strip and all I wanted was a quiet relaxing dinner. Little did I know that the Marquee nightclub was right next door and Holsteins tries to draw in that Saturday night crowd with a DJ playing loud booming music and having the waitresses wear short, tight, red dresses. But somehow, the Guava Float ($11) made all of that tolerable. I couldn't taste the booze but I was feeling that buzz :)  The Urth Burger ($13) was rockin! House-made vegan patty, lettuce, tomato, cucumber, sprouts & avocado. Yummmmmm!!! The skinny fries that it came with were also dangerously addictive. http://su.pr/2KKpvM  The artwork in here, which I think is created by a local artist, is kickass! One of my favorites: http://su.pr/6tjK9n  As good as everything was, it was also extremely filling. Thank goodness for leftovers that save me money while in Vegas! And yes, next day Urth Burger with skinny fries are still good!  Great food, great service, fun atmosphere. Who would've thought that a vegan can not only survive but be amazed by a burger & milkshake restaurant! Viva Las Vegas :)
149	0	I had a bad experience, although the hotel itself is not bad.  I was feeling ill during my stay (I was pregnant and didn't know it), and had been doubled over in bed with my iPod to comfort me.  I left the iPod in the sheets unknowingly, and when we checked out, I must have left it there.  Later that day, I called the LVH reporting I had most certainly left my iPod in the room (it has never been found in our possession since).  They sent someone up to look for it, but it was nowhere to be found, and housekeeping had already been through there.  It had not been turned in by housekeeping.  I don't know how many hotels hold housekeeping accountable, but they were never able to find out who took it.  Some housekeeping person has a very nice gift now.    Bummer.  As for the hotel, we find it to be a good deal, so we stay there occasionally.  It has decent restaurants and lively hallways.  The rooms are clean and attractive enough.  It's too bad they don't have a way of finding out who cleaned certain rooms to determine which of their staff are thieves.  Not sure how many hotels are able to do this anyways.  The experience was enough to make me not want to stay there next time.
150	1	The dipping sauces for the grilled meat were great! Highly recommend the happy hour. I had the spicy chicken with lemon sauce, broccoli, and the mushroom medley on brown rice. Definitely a good place if you're trying to eat healthy and on the cheap in Vegas.
151	0	Do not stay here! The room was so disgusting that I could not even spend the night. There were stains all over the carpet, it smelled musty/moldy, the bathroom was falling apart (i.e. the floor was missing pieces, the counter was stained, the shower was dirty), and on top of all of this the walls were paper thin! My fiance and I were only there 10 minutes before our neighbors arrived and we could hear their entire conversation. I understand not to expect much at the low rate they offer, but the fact that I couldn't even take my shoes off or was willing to put any of my belongings on the bed was enough to force me out of there. There are far better places to stay in Vegas!!
152	1	Wow, this place doesn't mess around with their chicken and waffles.  The chicken is roasted to perfection, they put bits of bacon in the waffle batter, and it comes with the most devine vanilla syrup ever.  This place has some of the best french bread I've ever had and their chocolate "bouchons" (basically chocolate cake in small cylinder shapes) go perfectly with the three different ice creams served on top.
153	0	Unfortunately, this bar has false advertisement provided by desperate promoters outside the bar. First off they give you a bracelet and make you believe that the entrance is free, when it really wasn't.  Second,  the promoter told us that the bar closes at 4 am, we got there about 2 am and they ended kicking everybody out at 315. FALSE ADVERTISEMENT!  I'll never go back.
154	1	Had an early dinner here with my bff.  We shared a liter of wine, and it was the best stinkin cab I have ever had.  Sadly, I don't remember what it was.. maybe cuz of the 1/2 liter of wine I had that night.  haha.    The food here is amazing!  Started with the hazelnut beet salad and wine glazed pork belly.. the salad had pickled ramps that were so tasty!  No strong onion flavor.. it almost tasted like asparagus with a light spring onion taste. And the pork belly was crispy and creamy at the same time!  Served with a ramp custard, the two were a match made in heaven.    For the main course, I had the pork loin served with a baked ramp custard, roasted Anjou pears and morels... To die for! Kinda tasted like Korean food.. which is a good thing.  Pork and green onion pancake (sahm gyup sal and pah jun).  My friend had the lamb, but I can't say too much about that since I don't like lamb.  :)  For dessert.. we had the creme brulee and Ill Flotante.  The creme brulee was pretty standard, but the ill flotante was like a fluffy cloud of dreamy goodness.  Haha.  it was soooo amazing!  airy meringue in a sea of anglaise and a little gravy boat of fleur de sel caramel sauce.. holy mother of all good desserts.    For the two of us, we spent close to 300.. yes, it's pricey, but for a splurge meal, it's as good as it gets!
155	0	Love the frozen hot chocolates but the service was really bad for us!! We sat down and waited for ten minutes and had to flag someone down to ask to take our order. "I'll find a server for you."  was his response. A family sat down right after and a server tended to them right away. We looked around and noticed that we were the minorities. Id hate to pull the race card but thats how I'm perceiving it. Disappointed is what I am.
156	0	What a disappointment! The food at our local hospital cafeteria is so much better! The "prime rib" was steamed. The turkey breast dry. The salads were messy. The sushi rolls tasted "off". And to add insult to injury we were seated in kiddie land. Why? We had no children with us. And we were seated where all the children (I counted 12, with different families/tables, under the age of 5) were going ultra sonic. There were plenty of tables available elsewhere. We pointed this out to the hostess who pointed to a table....2 feet away. Duh. Very annoying experience. This buffet was much better in 2004.
157	0	Our group ate a predetermined BBQ meal consisting of chicken, beef rib, beans, corn on the cob, salad, and a roll. Paula Deen would be proud. Much of the food I had in AZ was piss poor. I was hoping to order off the menu which I assume has got to be better. The view isn't all that great either. What is there to look at? The buildings downtown waaaay off in the distance?  The urinals(2) in the men's room are placed right next to each other almost like it's designed for siamese twins to pee in. There is no divider. What a joy to have some idiot step up and piss that close to me. I could only picture there being splatter all over my jacket & pants. Ugh, what an ordeal.
158	1	If your looking for a great Breakfast spot in the LV area, look no further.  This place was great.  I ordered 2 eggs over-easy, with Potatoes and bacon.  My wife got an omlet.  We also ordered a biscuits and gravy.  Everything was AMAZING!!!!!!  It can get kind of crowded in the AM on the weekends but its worth it.
159	1	This was a positively sublime burger-eating experience.  When in town for a weekend, this was the one place I wanted to make sure I stopped by, and I wasn't disappointed.  Buddy and I each ordered the kobe beef burger and couldn't have been happier.  The meat was prepared perfectly, and the list of available toppings was extensive.  I love that the toppings went from mild to wild and cheap to expensive.  This is probably the only place where one could get a burger with both shaved truffle slices and velveeta.  I went with carmelized onions and gorgonzola - delicious!  As others have said, you must try the sweet potato fries.  They are well worth the extra expense and are scrumptious.  One last piece of advice - do the call-ahead seating.  The restaurant doesn't do reservations, but you can call ahead up to a half hour.  My buddy and I did this and were able to walk right in upon arrival.  The place was packed, and the relatively huge line that formed behind us didn't care for us all that much.  In the end, the price was more than reasonable, given how well-prepared and customizable the meal is.  There may be a better burger somewhere else, but I certainly have yet to find it.
160	0	my friends and i stayed @ T.I. last week and and while waiting for our check in we went  to eat at my first Vegas buffet.  Ive had better "free school lunch" food! the only saving grace to this place was the dessert station, and the only standout there was the  Mini Crme brle
161	0	I've been to Tao about 6 times in the past 2.5 years and I've always wondered...what is the big deal?  Yes, the venue itself is pretty sweet...but pack it in with hundreds of sweaty people? Not so crazy about it.  The first time I came to Tao, I had a blast. The second time was great as well, and it just manages to go down hill from there.  The club is large and has several levels, a huge dance floor and a few different rooms to explore.  Not to mention Tao Beach that they managed to slap on the last couple of years.  It ended up just being an extra line to stand in getting in and out of Tao Beach.  Tao, to me, is an overrated, over-crowded club that isn't worth the hassle.  There are TONS of promoters for the club...and if you manage to walk around the Venetian during the day without getting hassled by one, I'll give you $1.  I think the endless lines and lists and eager club goers to get into this club is because of the promoters and the name itself.  So bravo! The people over at Tao accomplished what they were going for.  However, aside from the cool Asian-influenced decor and the HOT rose petal girls sitting in bath tubs, nothing else makes the club super worthwhile.  The crowd is about a B to B+, though the more people they let in, the scale starts to slide down a little.  Who would I recommend the club to? Co-workers I don't like.  It's just way too damn crowded.
162	1	It can be a long wait but it is definitely worth it!  I've been here twice on Saturday's and usually wait between 15-30 minutes and that was for 2 people.  Can't remember what I got the first time but I know I enjoyed it because I came back for seconds. The service is great, and they even have these placards on the table to let your server know you need service instead of being that person to flag them down. Very useful. Highly recommended!
163	0	Our dinner at the MGM Grand Buffet was horrible.  For $40 per person you think they would offer something that tastes good.  Everything we tried lacked flavor, even the crab.  I've never had crab legs that were absolutely flavorless.  The desserts were OK, but why pay $40 per person for dessert.
164	1	One word:  Ridiculousness.  I already knew Bachi Burger was amazing before their appearance on Triple D, but they really have outdone themselves with one of their newest burgers.  But first! The appetizers!  I had the oxtail chili cheese fries for the first time. The chili is sweet unlike the norm. And I liked the spicy mayo-like sauce that was drizzled with it. Lots of flavor and definitely filling. Make sure you share this one!  I also had their pork belly steamed buns. A nice thick, tender piece of pork belly in every white, fluffy bun. The pork belly was melt-in-your-mouth amazing, but the sweet hoisin-like sauce was the best. I could drink that.  Now onto the main attraction! I saw their Shogun burger written on their chalkboard of specials and I knew I had to have it. A burger made with a wagyu beef patty, foie gras, unagi, Asian pear and miso butter with a Yamamomo peach as a palette cleanser.   They had me at foie gras.  I come from Cali where the delicacy was recently banned, so I was all in with this burger!  You start off with the Yamamomo peach which looks more like a piece of lychee. It's the sweetest piece of fruit you'll probably ever have. Good stuff.  After you take one bite of the burger, you'll feel like eating it slowly so you can savor each bite. The saltiness from the foie gras enhances the sweetness of the pear and unagi. And there's also a hint of truffle oil on the top of the bun. The combination sounded weird at first, but all the flavors really work together. Probably the best burger I've EVER had, but it has a hefty price of $25... WORTH. EVERY. PENNY.  If you love foie gras and burgers, you definitely have to try it. Share it with someone if you have to. Just make it work!  By the way, there always seems to be a wait here, so don't starve yourself too much before you get there (like I did). You need to be awake to try this ridiculousness.   I can't wait for them to open up their next location in Los Angeles!
165	1	Slow service so have plenty of time. LOVE the food here. I recommend almond boba, the ronin burger, steamed buns, fish chips, and hot sake. My kind of night! Art on the wall is cool too. This place isn't for everyone. Seating is a little uncomfortable and you can here everyone else's dumb conversations. You also have to have a palate for this stuff. Also, hard to see from the street so keep your eyes peeled.
166	0	Quite fair.  For reference - I've been to several other churrascarias - from Boston, MA to Nairobi, Kenya.  I came in alone killing some time and needing a quick lunch while out in Vegas for a conference.  To be frank, the food quality at Pampas just kind of lacks.  The salad bar was mostly bland and ill-prepared or overcooked.  The service was fine, but sometimes awkward and at times brusk.  I attend my conference annually and won't be back to Pampas next year.
167	0	The air filtration system in the rooms are in poor condition. On two occasions of my stay here at the hotel, both times my room smelled like wet mops and mildew. I awoke coughing after an uncomfortable rest in a room that's scent choked my lungs.  The lobby staff IS friendly and aside of that, the rooms are , at most, barely tolerable.
168	1	WOOOO, Shake Shack. I still have dreams about you.  I'm so glad we decided to cancel our original lunch plans to stop in here. Best decision we made all day.  The was a bit of a lineup, but it moved quite quickly. After ordering, we're given a buzzer which was cool. A little more organized than calling out numbers. The location was kept very clean and modern inside. It wasn't too hard to find seats, as there is a lot of turn over here and guests are considerate to leave once done their meal.  We wanted to try the original, so we ordered the double, draft root beer and a strawberry shake. All GREAT! The burger was just so melt in your mouth delicious. It was a tad salty, but that didn't stop me from devouring this beast.  The shake was sooo friggen good. I would go back just for a shake, but it would be hard to resist a burger. The root beer was only alright, I'm not sure I would order it again.  Overall, I was amazed. Burgers are one of my favourite foods, I'm not easily amazed by a burger, but when I am, it's so eye opening.   This is a definite must when going to Vegas (or NY)
169	1	Brought a visiting friend here for a relaxed dinner before putting her on the RedEye.  Place was packed early on a Monday, and for good reason.  Absolutely divine.  As other reviewers have mentioned the Crispy Duck Panang is perfection, though, I ordered a level "6" spice and I could have gone up a couple of notches.  Prices are totally reasonable- 2 soup, 2 entree, 4 beers came out to under $70 including tip (and we had leftovers).  Service was prompt but not rushed and very friendly.  Ambiance is somewhat lacking, but food, service and value totally make up the difference.
170	0	Worst dining experience ever. Food took forever! Partially because I ordered a burger, subbed it with a veggie patty. $3 charge for that! Uh, veggie patties are cheaper than beef. Ordered no bbq sauce no bacon (I'm vegetarian). Comes out with bacon & BBQ sauce. Send it back, comes out when my fianc is already done eating. Has no sauce, but still has bacon. Send it back...comes out 5 seconds later with no bacon. Are you kidding me?! That's a refire! You don't just take the bacon off, by health code standards you have to make a new one! Cancelled the order. Waited for the manager for about 15 min. Poor waiter couldn't find her?! Another guy comes to apologize. Free dessert. That's it! Oh, & passed the lady manager on our way out of the building smoking a cigarette...nice! Smh. The place should be out of business. Almost 11:30pm so had to find somewhere else to eat so my finance could watch me eat since he had already eaten their terrible food. Sorry. But our waiter was a good kid trying at least. I hope he gets a job somewhere else :(
171	1	Went here for lunch on New Year's Day and it was amazing! The guys who work at the counter were so friendly and provided exceptional service! For our friend he was given a small slice (which really wasn't that small), but the guy at the counter threw in a free extra slice without us even a asking! Wow! Not only that, but the guy also made sure to give me a perfect slice! Seriously, the pizza was delicious, but what really won us over was how friendly and awesome the crew are! They also found out it was my boyfriends birthday and they made sure to all wish him well and gave him a yummy dessert on the house! We will definitely be sure to make secret pizza a vegas tradition from now on!! Wonderful experience!!!
172	1	Got the meat lovers, great selection  of multiple diffrent meats and spicyness. Banchan  was good all very tasty.included sea weed salad and green salad and miso soup .  Delicious all together could have used a bit more grilled vegetables(should have ordered that side) but usually when you think of kbbq  it's for the meat anyways!!! Got some happy hour drinks flavored soju  my sister got the ginger I got the green apple. Ginger was delicious! Green apple 2 as very green apple-ey ; P place is good food for decent prices!!! Great service and located not far from the strip stop in and nom nom nom!!!
173	1	Such an expensive burger, but if you're offering an east coast exclusive restaurant on the west coast, expect people to line up. My friends and I got here right before peak dinner hour so the line was negligible.   I got the SmokeShack, it was pretty good, idk if I liked the chili peppers? I really liked the bread and how flavorful the patty was. The cheese fries were alright, kinda felt like it tasted like fake cheese (like they put on nachos) but tasted less like "fake" cheese.  The restaurant was really clean and well-ventilated! I like the ketchup and mustard dispensers, you don't have to pump it. It's more like a ketchup and mustard faucet. Lol
174	1	One of the things I love in life the most is BRUNCH! The brunch at Bouchon has to be one of the best in town- definitely the best on the strip.   They have a large assortment of fresh fruit, pastries, drinks and entrees. I really enjoyed their pastry platter (a chefs selection), and their omelette special, which was ham and English cheddar. The waiter brought over the pastries first, and explained what each one was. They gave us a sweet and savory selection, which was really nice. Both were spectacular. Another item on the menu I highly recommend are the donuts. They are covered in cinnamon sugar and served with berry compote, vanilla, and chocolate sauces. A little decadent for breakfast but for brunch, I'd order 6!  Overall, this place has a magnificent ambience, great service, and wonderful food. Their something on the menu for the savory brunch lover, the "I'm actually gonna order lunch for brunch" guy, and the sweet tooth! Gotta try it at least once.
175	0	So my family went to Vegas to celebrate my daughter's birthday. Of course this is the perfect place to sing to her. I'm willing to spend $200-$300 for our family. We came in and it was 100 degree outside, we were all tired and hungry.  Then this family came and cut in, this lady ( the mom) cut in with a straight face and didn't even care cause she knows she's doing it on purpose. My husband told her husband we were in line but I said to him it's ok cause they were only party of 3 and we have 6 in our group anyway. Then I told my husband, "just be grateful your not married to that kind of woman." And the husband heard, the husband and her kid was embarrassed by that woman's attitude. People, don't embarrass your family just for a table! Anyway, so we got our table....our waitress asked what we want for a drink, I gave her our order and I said that's all and I said "That's all"....and she said, "that's all you are going to order". And I'm thinking for a drink "yes". She left and I saw her whispering to another waitress, and I'm like..... hmmmm???? Then I came close To her register and asked to sing for my daughter, so she said to order a desert, so I did and she  brought the sundae with a candle and DIDN'T even sing to my daughter.... She just left it on our table. So we just sang to my daughter, just us!!!! How RUDE!!!! Our waitress is this black lady, that looks like a unemployed stripper/semi retired prostitute. And she's also too slow!!! Then we were waiting to order, looking at their yummy looking food. And we can't understand why she's taking too long to come back. After 30 minutes she came back with a receipt!!!! WTF!!!!! There's six of us and we only ordered drinks and you thought that's all we're ordering!!!! Dumb waitress!!!! We're celebrating my daughter's birthday!!! Anyway we were so pissed that we just decided to leave. This place is understaff..... their sundae are too sweet, the frozen chocolate drink that everyone is talking about is too grainy. YuKkk!!! And they have one dumb black waitress that needs training. I can't believe I didn't check her name. The other waitress seem nice and faster. But she's just too slow and obviously this place is under staff. They overcharge people and their understaff. Ridiculous!!!! Never will I come to this place again!
176	0	I just got back from Vegas and had a great time at Tao - nice decor, beatiful people, and fun with friends. However, (this applies only to guys)why I give it such a low rating is that their bouncers and dress code are so whacked. If you look like you're too casual, even with a button down short sleeve shirt, they'll turn you away. If you're wearing brown shoes (Steve Madden), they'll also turn you away. If you don't tuck in your shirt (guys), they'll turn you away. WTF is up with that? Our groups of guys had to go back to the room, change shoes and shirts to go back and wait in line again...I think it's just ridiculous...who goes with tucked in shirts to a night club, I'm not going there for work. Oh in addition, if you go with a bunch of guys, you won't be able to get in unless you get a table/bottle service. They only allow 1:1 ratio of girl to guy or more girls and less guys in your group before they let you in.
177	0	I came here for lunch the day after my 21st and don't remember it being as spectacular as others have described. I do remember the line stretching out to Circus Circus and the variety of food being underwhelming. Definitely beats Hometown Buffet but for $20+ at lunchtime, they aren't the greatest deal on the strip, either. The quality of food seemed a notch above some others on the strip but it is definitely a bit overpriced considering the lack of variety. I would rather eat at Pharaoh's Pheast.
178	1	We love burgers! Saw this restaurant on Triple D.   We came here twice when we were in Vegas and ordered the following:  Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries (sweet flavor and good amount of chili cheese!) Kiki Burger (filled with umami flavor!) Salt & Pepper Garlic Fries (just like the name and tasted great!)  If you love burgers, and want to eat something different, get away from the strip and drive to Bachi! You will not be disappointed!
179	1	Date/Time: Sunday ~ 8:30pm Occasion:  Bachelorette party dinner Party of:  Six Ordered:  Half dozen oyster appetizer, Steak Frites, Fromage dessert Location: Cutesy Italy-like look, open spacing, nice romantic lighting.   Total incl gratuity: ~$66 pp  I am impressed.  I didn't what to think initially but there was not one item that I, or any of the other girls, ordered that we were not pleased with.  The oysters we got were an assortment but by far the best oyster would have to be the Chelsea Washington oyster.  It as though I slurped up a piece of buttery goodness.  My mouth is watering thinking of it.  If I could go back in time, I would order a dozen more of those.  My flat iron steak came with a mountain of fries.  The meat, which was medium, was SO good considering it was a flat iron steak.  The girls tasted my steak and were in love.  The endless fries were crispy and a delicious compliment.  I had a bite of the pork chop, which was amazing.  Tender, succulent, juicy...the way pork should taste.  As always, any where that serves cheese will always get me so I ended my perfect meal by ordering the three cheeses for dessert: Valle d'Aspe (sheep's milk), Mt. Tam (cow's milk) and the Onetik Bleu (sheep's milk).  They were magnificent!  I thought the prices were incredibly reasonable, service was friendly, and the food was absolutely delightful.  Would I return?  Most certainly so.    Good choice!  Job well done, Thomas Keller! :)
180	1	I was here twice in one week during a convention, the second time was greated with a welcome back, nice ot have you again.  The service was perfect, not in my face but not ignored and my water glass was never more than 1/2 empty.  As a grey haired woman of a certain age, I am honestly not used to be treated with such respect and courtesy.  And, of course, the food was great, especially the smoked beef tartare, which was outstanding.  I was also impressed with the wine recommendations.   I must compliment Mr. Teresi for his oustanding staff
181	1	This place is a MUST! BURGERS are absolutely delicious!   Kalbi burger- never knew Kimchi would taste so good inside a burger! ordered this with a fried egg. the patty was thick and the sauce was amazing!  I will definitely come back to try other things from their menu!
182	0	I went to the grab and go window.  1 star for the service, 2.5 for the food.  They don't serve hot food before 11:30am, cashier was kind of rushy and impolite, and didn't let me order nachos--even though it was 11:25am.  She didn't even register all the items we wanted to order.  Food: The donut is big and Ok. The frozen hot chocolate is meh.  Not bad if there's nothing else around, but not really worth $17.  I'll probably avoid this place in the future.
183	1	My server Alyssa was amazing. Very kind, always had a smile on her face and made sure everything was good with us. Also her manager Marc was amazing and making sure we enjoyed our service. I will definitely be returning and telling my friends about the wonderful service and food.
184	1	This place was a bit of a surprise. I was not expecting so much flavor from the basic white cheese slice. Yeah it is tucked away down some hall took my group about 20 minutes to find it. We were walking right passed it. But that single slice was worth it.
185	0	I had a fairly disappointing experience at Tao this past Friday night.  I booked a table here for my bachelorette party.  Even though we paid extra for the guaranteed main room table placement, we still weren't in the desirable table area and were pretty much in the hallway, which was annoying after paying so much extra for what I thought was one of the good tables.  The service at the table was great - we got brought in quickly, our security/ drink pourer guy was great, waitress was very friendly.    As a girl, I like to wear very high heels.  And at Tao that was no exception - I wore my 5 inch high stilettos and as usual enjoyed attempting to look like I could walk in them while drinking.  TWICE I was brought to the "drunk girl" area and told that I am too drunk, clearly cause I was stumbling in my shoes.  They made me take my shoes off, walk in a straight line, and talk to them for a bit to I was completely fine, which I was.  It was extremely frustrating that after paying a shit ton for a table to be carted off and told I'm about to get kicked out for not being able to walk in my shoes, just to twice have them confirm I'm completely fine.  There were nicer, better, and faster ways to handle that situation.  The dance floor was REALLY packed.  IMO I think it is too small as it was almost impossible to move around out there.  I would have preferred a little more room.  Also as part of the bachelorette package, I was supposed to get a cake, and the cake never came.  I complained the next morning and they sent the cake to my hotel room which was nice but it didn't arrive till after we went out for the evening which was annoying  Anyways - I would never go back to Tao, but I'm sure it's not terrible for everyone.  Make sure to wear shoes you can walk in :)
186	1	Yum!! I go to Vegas a lot for business and am always stuck in the hotels and convention centers. I look forward to the Burger Bar and always have a pleasant experience! The best thing there? The zucchini fries! The best sandwich? The salmon 'burger' on ciabatta, with sauted portobello mushrooms and spinach. Actually heavenly. I can't wait to go back!!!
187	1	Crazy Bernie is a big fan of Gordon's and puts his money where his mouth is by going into this great spot each and every time he goes to Paris LV about 4x a year. Beef Wellington just like what they make on Hell's Kitchen is out of this world. Got to meet chef Christine the first time I went soon after she won the head chef position.  Highest quality food with prices in line with quality level. When you say no to Gordon Ramsey Steak....you say no to life!
188	0	the wait was long. ordered the lobster omelette and crabcake something. wow, don't even remember, that's not a good sign. I'm particular about my crabcakes. Not too much bread crumbs, that's good, but the crab was all shredded. I'm looking for lumps! Had a mimosa, that they forgot. I don't think i need to go back ;/
189	0	- - FOOD POISON - - BAD SERVICE - - AWFUL MANAGEMENT - -  We stayed at Mandalay Bay for our Vegas trip and decided to get something to eat late night, unfortunately the only place open was Citizens Kitchen. We walked in and got seated, the server had problems taking our orders and since he thought he could remember everything without writing it down he then brought out some of the food wrong. It took them 30-35minutes to bring out the food. No one wants to wait that long for food at 2am. Five out of  six people ordered the same food and it was the Burger and let me tell you that the vacation ended right there! Every single person had the worst stomach pain and you can imagine the rest!  I asked for a refund  the following day,  the managers told me that I should send an email with my experience so they could look it over, Nick one of the managers actually tried to help and he told us that they were very embarrassed over this and would do anything to fix it so he asked for the receipt and that he would refund the money, until today I only received $45 out of almost $180, they couldn't even track our bill and refund the rest being that they have an advanced POS system. It took them 3 weeks to refund the $45 while I had to text and call everyday.  Two of the five  people that had food poisoning  actually went to the doctors the day after and were told that it was 100% food poisoning.  Save yourself some time  and pain, do not  go to this place. It has awful food and service. I will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone!  - - - FOOD POISONING IN VEGAS ON YOUR 1st DAY OF VACATION, HOW MUCH FUN IS THAT - - -    Manadalay Bay should seriously think about renting to this place since they are inside of this hotel and getting so many bad reviews...........
190	0	Overrated and pricey!  I wanted chinese noodles but got soup instead.  The mexican dishes were very bland.  I immediately got a stomach ache from the food.  Paid close to $90 for four small plates for dinner.  My feelings hurt more than my tummy.  Gave this two stars because the service was good at least.
191	0	To put it briefly: we paid $98 for a dinner that left me wishing we'd just hit the Chipotle down the hall in the mall. I don't mind paying Las Vegas strip prices when the food is good, but this was a huge disappointment.  The service was fine but the food was some of the most mediocre stuff I've ever had - and I'm not usually picky.  I'm not sure how one manages to make bad potato skins, but they did. For entres we had the ahi tuna salad and the steak and eggs. The eggs were watery (how do you make watery scrambled eggs? I don't know, but they managed that too!), the tuna salad had four tiny pieces of tuna that were chewy and the greens were utterly tasteless. I also ordered a lemon drop cocktail which tasted like someone mixed a small amount of liquor in some watery blue kool aid.  Needless to say, we didn't bother with dessert.  If you're getting food around here, either go cheap and hit the food court or go to the Gordon Ramsay place where you'll pay the same price and actually enjoy your meal.
192	1	Mouth. Watering. Pizza.   I can't tell you how good this pizza is. It's a great combination of salty and cheesy goodness. I always get either a slice of their mushroom pizza or white pizza. Their mushroom pizza is delicious + a little bit of added chili flakes makes the saltiness of the pizza all come together for a flavorful bite. Their white pizza is probably one of their more famous pies and with good reason, it's delicious! It's a mozzarella (and parmesan?) based slice topped with ricotta cheese. At first, I thought it would be too much cheese for my liking but it all somehow comes together as cheesy goodness.  Now, the crust...it's all about the crust!! The pizza itself is thin with a slight crunchy bite to it. The crust is crispy but with a doughy inside that I love. The slices run pretty big so it's worth the price! ($5/6) Usually all it takes is one slice for me to be done, two if I'm super hungry. I've never had to wait in a long line to place my order (my wait is usually like 5 mins) but I've been told it can get pretty crazy late night when the clubs close.  My only complaint about the pizza is that it can be a little too oily. Seeing small puddles of greasiness is kind of gross, but nothing a pat down with a napkin won't fix. Just wish I didn't have to perform this messy task before eating it.   Seating is available inside (best for parties of 2, not so much for bigger parties) & all around the lounge type area but it can be difficult to find an open space during a busy night. The pizzeria itself is located on the 3rd floor of Cosmo, down a hallway across from the escalators.
193	1	i have been coming here for the last 8 years or so.  i first heard of LOS in a gourmet magazine article and had to try what the craze among all the food critics was all about.  from the first time i ate there till the um-teenth time, it never disappoints.  i always stop by for lunch when i'm in las vegas.  i've enjoyed almost everything i've tried here...don't forget to try some of the northern thai items...the northern style larb and pork stew is especially good.  then finish the meal off with coconut ice cream and the coconut sticky rice with fresh mangos.  N.B. if you go for lunch, do not get the buffet.  you've been warned ;-)
194	0	First off, this hotel is GHETTO!!! I came here to enjoy a juicy burger and check out hot skanks, this was the wrong place to go. The parking structure is insane! its so tiny and awkwardly designed, you can barley drive your car through it! consider yourself lucky if you happen to find parking. The elevators from the parking structure to the hotel/casino were semi-working. I got inside the death trap and it began to shake aggressively, stopped for a few seconds them shook again and proceeded to the main floor. Once inside the casino, it was filled with old white men, JUST men! and a few 60 something year old cocktail waitress'. I got to the restaurant, and to my surprise ALL the Hooters girls looked like something out of the Hills Have Eyes! the only hot waitress i spotted was like 7 months pregnant!.....ew. We ordered our food, 10 min go by....20 min go by....30 MINUTES go by.....ummm where the fuck is my burger? i asked my server what happened to our order, and she says "oh, umm you have to wait, the food always takes a long time" (we ordered a burger and a salad, nothing more!) after 40 minutes, i told her to cancel our order and close our beer tab. She says "ok, BYE" didn't even call a manager over or anything. VERY unprofessional.
195	0	Service sucked we came here two nights in a row after going out so it was prob close to 4 am.  We were the only people eating there both nights on a Sunday and Monday and our food took forever everyone who worked there was rude.  We only went again on Monday because it was the only thing open at Planet Hollywood and didn't feel like searching anywhere else out!  Food was ok when your super tired and hungry but we were so annoyed by the staff it wasn't worth it.  Def don't go!
196	1	DEFINITELY WORTH THE DRIVE We found our way here by accident last year and made a point of going back this year. Everything is delicious that we have ordered. Pork carnitas skillet was perfection. Apple cinnamon pancakes were delicious as was the often-mentioned banana nut muffin. Come hungry or share...they are generous with their portions.
197	1	Absolutely amazing! The place was busy but we were still seated right away. We didn't have to wait at all for our food. Our banana nut muffins were so fresh they were still warm. We all got different things off of the menu and liked everything we had. Lisa was our waitress- she was very friendly, and very efficient.  We will definitely stop here again when we visit vegas!
198	0	Don't get fooled by the name or television references. Serendipity's is just famous for its name and their food is quite awful (and very overpriced.) If the food actually had some flavor to it or was ACTUALLY COOKED, the price would be worth it. My friend and I ordered the mac and cheese, hamburger slides, and the famous water-tasting like frozen hot chocolate. The food was not cooked and the frozen hot chocolate tasted like it was ran down with water, which I think was the case. The macaroni noodles were super hard because they were undercooked and the hamburger patty was blood-red inside. How gross. Even if you want to check this place out and try the frozen hot chocolate, make sure to get a small as it is enough for 2-3 people. They trick you by asking would you like one for one person or however many people are in your party just to empty your pocket. It was definently not worth a 45 minute wait in the hot, sticky weather in vegas.  P.S. Don't wear one of your favorite shirts here. I don't know what is wrong with their tables but if you push down on the table with your elbow or hand while you are dining, your table will tilt and your food and drinks will go everywhere. While we were eating, the people next to us put their elbow on the table and their water cups flew into the air and spilled everywhere. Funny thing is, 5 minutes later I was getting up to go to the restroom and put my hand on the table to get up and the next thing you know, my cup of iced cold water spilled all over me and onto the floor. On my way to the bathroom, another party had a water spill which proved that the customers aren't clumsy, their tables are bad! My point being is, don't wear your favorite outfit here.
199	1	While I base my culinary life on David G.'s teachings, I must have been there on a good night or had a little Vegas luck left over because I had an amazing experience! He's right- the place has pretty much nothing English about it and is a two story glass box, but I did like the welcome; upon approaching the Host desk, you are greeted by a half dozen Identical 6 foot tall brunettes in the same little black dress. I thought I'd wandered onto a Robert Palmer video set! (lf you haven't heard of him you betta ax somebody!). We were then escorted upstairs to a rail side table overlooking the bar and entrance areas as well as a spectacular  chandelier- type lighting fixture. Very well appointed room and tables.  WHEN YOU GO- We started with the gnocchi and fried oysters. Both were very good with the oysters being my favorite. Perfectly crisp and juicy at the same time, I could have had three plates of those and been very happy. I also had the filet, which was the best I've ever had and I've had a few steaks. I usually order either a rib eye or Porterhouse, but was advised to try the filet by our outstanding server Mathew. And he was right! Perfect medium rare, juicy and flavorful to the last bite, it was incredible. Wifey had the Wellington which was very good, but I found the sauce to be a little salty and the philo didn't stand up to it very well. Good flavor and the meat was perfectly done. We also had the toffee bread pudding and if I could change one thing about the meal it would have been that. I'm not much of a bread pudding fan but after Matthew's home run with the filet suggestion, I followed his lead on this one. Very sweet, and the bread was saturated to the point of nearly being mush. I'll be going for the apple tart next time (my wife wins again!). All in all a five star experience for me. Hope it is for you too!
