1000	1	I'm surprised i have not reviewed this place yet!! By far my favorite restaurant in vegas... i know there is no famous chef here, or the place is not named after a famous chef, but hey its 24 hours, the best bread on the strip and servings are huge!! IMO an upscale cheesecake factory... the fries are DELICIOUS... and those philly cheese egg rolls or something like that are pretty yummy as well!!  Definitely go here at least 2 times on all my visits to sin city! Wait is never too bad and prices are decent, much better than the overpriced restaurants in vegas, and i can come here in PJs!!
1001	1	We stayed at the NYNY hotel and walked past this place quite a bit before we decided to stop and try it. I had the Roadshack (I think) with fries. It was delicious. The burger was cooked perfectly and had really good flavor, the caramelized onions on top were also super delicious. We had a chocolate shake that was very good. It was chocolaty but not too sweet, like it was made with real chocolate. It was a little crowded i side but that's to be expected. Customer service was also oustanding!
1002	0	Food portions here are absolutely vile, there is just no need to serve such huge plates of food especially when you see the amount going back to the kitchen wasted.  You see enough homeless people in Vegas and this wastage just annoys the hell out of me.  The service was terrible when we went for breakfast one morning, we were seated straight away but it was absolutely ages before we placed our order with the waitress and then again for drinks to turn up and then for the food to turn up.  The quality of food was on par with Dennys but was at least twice the price.    I won't bother with this place again, maybe dinner is better but I won't be giving it a try.
1003	0	This hotel was an absolute disappointment. We paid a great price online but walked into a room that was run down and raggedy. There was black mold on the outside of the bath tub and mysterious yellow goo on the bathroom door. My husband is allergic to dust mites, so the two inch layer of dust underneath the headboard of the bed almost sent him into an asthma attack. I complained every morning I was there, but they didnt do much. The only electrical outlet with enough outlets to charge my phones did not work. The bathroom light was broken and the closet door did not open and close. I will never stay here again.
1004	1	So Hash House A Go Go...  Most people have heard of this place because of Man vs. Food, but I've been a fan of this place for a long time.  Its one of the few places I can say that almost every meal I've had here is a hit.  The prices are decent when you discover that the portions are HUGE.  Beware, you might not finish a meal here.  I've been here countless times, and I've yet to manage to avoid having to take out.  My 2 favorites would have to be either the Chicken Pot Pie or the Fried Chicken Eggs Benedict.  Both of which are ridiculously awesome, and both are one hell of a twist on a classic dish.  The Chicken Pot Pie is essentially a deep fried sombrero on some mash potatoes with the "filling" poured on top.... Its just magical.    The wait usually is pretty long if you go during the peak hours, ie brunch, lunch, dinner, but its totally worth it.  One of my favorite restaurants in Vegas, if not my favorite restaurant in Vegas.  A must go.
1005	0	The food is OK. The price is a little bit higher than outside but you should appreciate they can bring authentic Chinese food into the middle of a casino. The major problem here is that the place always asks how you are going to pay BEFORE placing order. It suggests the place may suffer from ample unpaid checks at ... Bellagio. So show them your wallet BEFORE placing orders to calm them down.
1006	0	Came here for the lunch meal of my Buffet of Buffets day.  Kind of tricky to find as you have to go downstairs from the casino to get to the buffet.    They had tons of stations organized by regions of the world: Middle Eastern, American, Italian, Mexican, Seafood and Salad.  I tried the shrimp cocktail, shrimp tempura, pesto pasta, mashed potatoes, sweet potatoes and designed my own taco.  Nothing was particularly good except the shrimp tempura and sweet potatoes.    This was the buffet with the most esthetically pleasing desserts.  They all looked amazing, so I grabbed a chocolate cream pie, creme brulee, eclair and fruit tart.  Nothing tasted good.  I then decided to get myself some chocolate custard to satisfy my sweet craving.  It was completely liquid and melted.  Disappointing since I'm big on desserts.    May be worth stopping by if the meal is comped or you're a Planet Hollywood guest that is too lazy to go anywhere else.  I wouldn't pay to go back.
1007	0	I've been coming to this buffet before it was even called Flavors... Basically it's like an international buffet but the variety within each country is limited. The quality reminded me of hometown buffet, but it gets the job done of getting you full.  Came here during breakfast not really hungry. Stuffing yourself in sin city, what they hey? seems appropriate. There was nothing that I didn't try at this place. If you dined with me before at a buffet, you'd know I eat a lot (like there's no tomorrow). They had an omelet bar which seemed like a hit due to the line, but I'm against the whole waiting in line in a buffet while food is all around you.  I can point out many flaws of this place. Service sucked coming from a deaf server who worked as slow as a Windows 98 computer, prime rib was as chewy as the Trident gum I had in my pocket, scrambled eggs had a cake texture that you had to cut through, breakfast sausages had a casing stronger than my iPhone's, crab legs were puny, sushi tasted and looked like two colored lego pieces.   Couple of goods were the bacon, crisp, unburnt with a great porky taste. Broccoli were steamed to the right texture. The sashimi got me going back for more. I had a good 2 or 3 platefuls of these suckers. The best thing you can creatively make at this place is tuna w/ 'broccoli rice' wrapped in bacon "sushi". I also got bored with flavors from eating everything separately so I made prime rib tacos, mock sausage bacon and egg biscuits from McDonalds, vanilla tart using vanilla syrup and a heart waffle, and a sashimi sandwich with a dinner roll.   For about 25 bucks a head, you'll get full off of "ehh" quality food, but it gives you a reason to be playful as well because you won't feel so bad from eating plates of bland food.   P.S. - save room for dessert and don't eat here! They skimp on the sugar, oil, butter or something that has to deal with sweets' flavor. There's a Ghirardelli shop a couple steps from the buffet that'll oversatisfy your taste buds for sure.
1008	1	Everyone is sooooo nice here. The customer service is great and of course the food is amazing. Not only will I be coming back as much as possible I will recommend it to my friends. I'm not a huge beef person but I got the lonely bird which was recommended to me and it is more than delicious. Milkshake infused alcohol is amazing as well. Everything is just so perfect about this place.
1009	0	VERY disappointing!! Even after a lot of drinking the hot dogs here sucks!!! First they are expensive as hell and lack flavor. The flavor is going depend on what kind of hotdog you order. The hotdog itself is blan!  GO to Earl of Sandwich, ALSO in planethollywood, you will NOT be disappointed.
1010	1	Went all out for this meal. A5 Kobe beef, just wow. Melt in your mouth heaven. For sides we had Brussels sprouts, asparagus, Mac n cheese and creamed spinach. All very good.   Dessert can't go wrong with English toffee caramel cake and brown butter ice cream. Overall amazing!!  Gordon steak 2/2! Great Job!
1011	1	Finally breakfast is something fun again.  Hash House A Go-Go has made breakfast hip and fun again.  The food is terrific.  Giant portions of flavorful, unique and delicious food.    It is a expensive...for breakfast, but not for the original food.    This place is much more than eggs and hash browns.  It is an experience.
1012	0	I am not sure if it is the fact that this Lee's Sandwich is located in Las Vegas, that the owners feel compelled to follow the lead of other well-known and loved California-based eateries (i.e., Pinks Hotdog, Sam Woos) that set up shop here, by jacking up the price and cutting back on what it serves.  At least that is what I think after visiting Lee's post their officially grand opening.  Sandwiches still taste the same, except you just get less of everything that goes in between the fresh baked baguette (meat, pickled radish and carrots and even cilantro and slices of chilie).  Iced coffee still tastes great, except you get more ice than coffee.  Even if you ask for less ice, you will get less ice but also a cup that is not full (imagine an inch of nothing to top of your plastic cup).  Anyway, the place is new and very nice looking.  Staff is still trying to master the sandwich menu, so I am sure eventually they will get faster with fulfilling the orders.  But unless they start to serve what we can get normally at all the other Lee's sandiwch shops up and down California, potential customers are better off patronizing other local banh mi shops.  And there are quite a few of them just a few blocks down Spring Mountain Rd.  I wish I can like this Lee's Sandwich more, but after a few visits I am too disappointed to want to go back.  As it stands, I feel that this Lee's is trying to set the bar extremely low for what customers should expect from this location, perhaps not realizing that a vast majority of the patrons have had the Lee's experience from California prior to visiting this one.  I can only guess that as a new food service operator in Las Vegas, they failed to do any sort of market or demographic analysis and/or extremely ignorant of the commonsense knowledge that roughly 50% of the visitors that come to LV are visiting from CA (land of the Lee's Sandwiches).  So we will see how well they fare after the novelty wears out, because without a course correction I see only iceberg ahead for this Titanic of a Lee's Sandwich.  (UPDATE) - From David Y: A worker told him to ask for "less ice and more coffee" when ordering their Lee's Iced Coffee, otherwise the future lawyers fulfilling the orders behind the counter will do exactly as the customer requested. How knew ordering a effing cup of the common Vietnamese Iced Coffee is the stepping stone to studying for the LSAT.
1013	0	Upon my arrival there were only a few people standing for check-in but there is no front desk staff available. I could understand the wait if there was people standing around. Then, I was dragged into a room by a staff and instead of expediting the check-in, it resulted to being much worst. The  VOLARIS cabin crew are being checked-in at that time and the clerk too them a while. The clerk that was to help me to pass to another clerk check in another group and she said "OH I CANNOT MOVED BECAUSE I AM BUSY".  She said this in front of the customer/guest. She cannot move her chair because of her size (no offense meant). She ended up moving to the front to walk around the table to go to her table to check me in while another customer was neglected ahead of me. So I decided to let him go first and for me to wait again. I worked in the airline industry and deal with hotels for my crew and these crew check-in process needs to be updated. Way too long to check-in 5 crew members.  Went to my room, checked the room itself, asked to be transferred to another room. I checked the room itself and bed, found some hairs on the mattress. Toiletries that's was in the room is half empty. Is this a leftover of the former occupant of this room?  My bathroom lights were out, so I called the front desk and was put on hold for a while ending up hanging up and calling back again. Roughly I was in the hotel at 3Pm and it took like 3 phones calls for the bathroom lights to be fixed. One maintenance guy came at at 8pm to fix the light but I cannot let him in at that time so I asked him for another time.  Then I asked for extra towels, it never happened. I ended up the next morning looking for housekeeping cleaning up the room to ask for extra towels. I asked for an extra towel regularly for my stay not for just one day but it never did happen. Every time I go the LAS VEGAS I use the SPA. I visited and check the spa and nothing comparable to the others. Expensive and the value is not worth using it.   The worst part of my stay is EARLY MORNING 9AM. I went down to Fortuna to buy coffee. It was pretty busy but not that busy. I ordered coffee and a pastry. I was paying and this rude cashier wearing eyeglasses told me PER SE word by word in a very rude manner "YOU HAVE TO TELL ME WHAT YOU ORDERED  BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU ORDERED". If I woke up in a wrong side of the bed this morning, this will be a long discussion. This cashier clerk/barista has a look that looks like she is just working and not happy at all with what she is doing, arrogant and rude. As, I walk the lobby every day and see her I had to do something about it. That was my first and last time I bought something from that store.  My room was non-smoking but I smell cigarette burning in the room. I don't know if it was a guest smoking or the ventilation of the room itself. I called the front desk, so the nth time, I was put on hold again, ending up calling again and again. They offered to be transferred but I decline because I was going to check-out the next day. Front desk promised to spray the room with something, but I guess when I came back, it never did happen.  Upon my check-out I decided to do something about the Fortuna Shop and express my frustrations.  If you have any other choices that this hotel..move on
1014	0	Golden Corral in general is just not what they make it see on tv bottom line. The only thing I liked about this was the service. Im never coming back here. For $18.00 i literally cant believe it. The food quality is cheap and gross. Took not more then 2 bites of my dinner and the proceeded   To the fruits and sweet section. Even my favorite bread pudding i feel like its so good everywhere I go but not here... It was dry and just eh. And dont even get me started on the ratchetry At this location, even though I know its just the location but still.
1015	0	Okay I have been coming here on and off for five years.My kids remember the atmosphere and what was awesome food and great steaks. Wait a minute did I say great steaks.?  What the heck has happened.?The last two times I have been here since a few years ago have really changed things. I could not even cut my steak. Neither could my son who travelled all the way from Montana to revisit his memories of the roost.  And c'mon guys no cotton candy for the kiddies on the Fourth of July. Well I paid for the steak but won't be spending any money here for a long long time.
1016	0	This review is based on the wait, I hope the food will make up for it or I will be extremely upset. On a Sunday, we got here at 12:15 and was told 30-40 minute....cool that's fine we will go gamble for that time frame. We get a text at 1:22 that our table is ready, more than 30-40 mins but no big deal. We get into the restaurant and order food by 1:33pm, we really wanted the lunch/dinner menu but was told it doesn't begin until 2pm and are told that we could go out and wait for 30 minutes if we like....ummm ok....so at 2:15 our food is delivered to our table...so we couldn't just order off of the menu we wanted and wait but our food doesn't arrive until 2:15? Ok...not cool...oh btw there are 3 of us ordered chicken and waffles, Cobb salad and a breakfast burger smh.  Update food was terrible.
1017	0	If I had never been to a Brazilian steakhouse before, I would have still thought the service a bit slow.  However, having been to Fogo de Chao and a couple of others like it in Atlanta, I know how good it can be and this doesn't measure up.  If you are paying big money on the strip you should match or outdo anything in Atlanta, so to see this fall short is really disappointing.  Someone in Vegas set this thing up and is just going through the motions.
1018	0	If you're even able to locate the dungeon where this buffet is located you may get to go down and enjoy their less then mediocre food.   I'd say wait maybe 20 minutes before you get food, you don't want to choke on the dry food and your waitress won't be around with a drink until then. Their salad bar was equipped with only the very basics and had nothing special. I could see my reflection in the grease sitting on top of the pizza. And for dessert you either can have cupcakes or cupcakes.   Over all very unpleased and you're honestly  doing yourself an injustice by picking this buffet over any other ones on the strip.
1019	1	As one of the greatest Thai restaurants in the Las Vegas Valley, one should take the time to plan a night of epicurious nirvana that so happens to be located in a strip mall that reminds me of that classic Queen song: thunderbolt and lightning, very very frightening MAMA MIA! But that shouldn't deter you. Yes, my friend, it is like a back street in Mogadishu at night, but during the day it's like The Troubles in Northern Ireland. Ha ha, but seriously. I tried the pad thai, and it was deeeelish. The noodles were cooked just right, and the seasoning was spot on. The freshness of the mung beans was beyond reproach, and the flourish with the peanuts would have made Michelangelo weep. I mean, this isn't as good as any pancit, but it was good for Thai food. Have I spoken about the duck curry? Spiced to my liking, since my constitution is vey delicate, dearest reader. And with the accompanying noodles, elevated these simple ingredients to a paragon of poultry paradise. And the best part of all is the skin, which was very crispy. Not as crispy and delicious as lechon, but that's comparing pig skin and duck skin, and there's no comparison (since pig skin is infinitely more deeeelish.)
1020	1	When we first walked in it was a bit overwhelmingly with the noise and it's a wide open space.  They seated us very quickly and got to omit drinks right away.  One server Erin came to our table slowly there after to take our order and answer any questions we had.  My wife doesn't eat regular sausage and we were very impressed with the vast ability to substitute. We were here for breakfast, but i peeked at the lunch menu and you can build your own burger with ground beef, chicken breast, turkey, or a vegetable patty.  I had the fiesta green chili skillet and it was amazing.  Perfectly spiced and filling.   My wife had a burrito and substituted turkey sausage and fruit.  We each got one of the banana bread muffins which I highly recommend. Erin was our server and she was very attentive and pleasant.  This was a nice way to start the day.  I highly recommend making this past of your Vegas stay.
1021	1	If you find yourself wandering on the 3rd floor trying to determine if you dressed appropriately swing back down to this joint. The price is decent and the food will surprise you (hopefully for the better). I had the brisket burger while visiting in Vegas and it made me forget about In and Out for at least a few hours. Honestly this place gets pretty creative with their burgers which I commend them for and the fries are awesome. I didn't get a shake because the beer selection was so good. I did get a pretty decent grumbly stomach after eating here but in all fairness I had been eating all sorts of junk including fried pickles and the Swedish fish candy from NY,NY hotel. I would visit again next time I'm in Vegas.
1022	1	We were originally getting a breakfast buffet at the Wynn and decided it was too pricey. Did a quick yelp search and Egg & I appeared.  To make the review short: the skillets were huge and nicely made. Prime rib benedict was on point. But the star? The warm muffin. Could just eat that for breakfast and nothing else.  Service is great too. Our server, Thay, took our group pictures voluntarily and filled our glasses and coffee mugs frequently. Awesome food and service makes for a great experience.   Casino buffets move aside. Come here for breakfast but leave a spot open for me.  5/5 would come again.
1023	1	I'm in love! I'm super thankful for the awesome Bouchon staff that was able to accommodate me for a quick and delicious Sunday Brunch before I left Vegas on a jet plane.  I told the host that I needed to be quickly seated and out of the Restaurant in less than 50 minutes. The host told me that I could immediately be seated at the bar, which I found my way just fine. The server was extra attentive to my needs and understood the immediacy of my visit. He recommended a few dishes and even the Manager (so i think it was) came to the table to let me know that their French Toast could be made immediately.   I decided to take my chances on time and go with the Salmon Baguette and the Yogurt Parfait. They also served a complimentary twisty bread with jam and butter. Mmm...! Everything was so neatly displayed and delicious. Don't you just LOVE brunch time?  Anyway, to keep it short, Bouchon was fab and the service was exceptional! They even bumped my order to the top of the list to get me out of the Restaurant on time. I will definitely visit Bouchon again try out other items from their menu without having to be in a rush.  Je t'aime Bouchon. Je t'aime.
1024	1	Delish. 2nd time I've been there and just as good as the 1st time. Got the special, Hobb's Pork Loin Benedict and it was uh.maze.ing!! Oysters were fresh and so cold. And their bacon is the best. EVER. Everyone delivers solid service and the food won't disappoint. Will be back next time I'm in Vegas. #obsessed
1025	1	We came here for the happy hour appetizers. It's a pretty solid kbbq joint. The service is good, the food is excellent, and the atmosphere is very chill. I brought my family here along with my 1 year old, it is very kid friendly. Don't forget to save room for the macaroon ice cream sandwich!
1026	0	We came here to watch the playoffs. I made a reservation since I knew it was going to be busy. I knew everyone will be looking for a table to watch the games. The host told me not to worry and that my table will be ready. When I got there, I didn't get my table and we had to wait for the upstairs to open. This bar was not ready to host any big games. The bartender that served my margarita didn't make it right. So easy to mess up a margarita..  Food was ok. Regular bar food. They were not very accommodating especially when you have reservations. The hostess just sat everyone that walked in. She had no clue about playoffs Sunday. I should've just watched the games at the sports book in a casino. Atleast they give out free drinks!
1027	1	OMG!!!  this place is the best, as soon as i found it, i came back every day i was in town!  I always get a couple slices of the White pizza, a lot of garlic, but i like that!  it is really good, thats just my opinion!  A must go to spot at the Cosmo!
1028	1	I like to keep some of my beloved places a secret, but facing nostalgia at its best, saving Secret Pizza as my secret is cruel for pizza connoisseurs.   The fanciest pizza I've ever tasted was anything of the ordinary from the countless pizza parlours of Italy. To me, margherita pizzas were a real treat, gently wrapped in parchment paper at 2 a slice, and an additional 1,50 for sea salted chips.   However, there is something different about Secret Pizza. You can find this little gem on the third floor between the corners at the Cosmopolitan. Purchased by the slice or by whole, the open face kitchen allows you to choose your slice of heaven from white pizzas to red pizzas. When I first tasted Secret Pizza my friends purchased whole pies of everything pizza and a pepperoni pizza, and even at 2am, they were outstanding & melty, just the way I like my cheesy pies. On my last trip here I tried the white ricotta + sausage pizza which is now my only preference. Full of flavour with just the right strength of spice & herbs, this pizza was a winner on my taste buds.   Keep in mind that the line to Secret Pizza is absurd; I think the best option is to telephone in your whole pie only. Although I am not a pizza aficionado like I used to be when I was under 10 years old, I love Secret Pizza so much that I would purchase a whole pie for myself, even if my companion didn't like Pizza Secret! x
1029	1	Came here for my morning hangover. Had a "ballast point" beer in my hand and the guy behind the counter recognized it! Wearing a white t shirt with a hat that said "original". Great customer service I feel bad I didn't have cash and only tipped a $1 because it wasn't until after I tipped he started talking. Also another dude with tats who serviced us and was super kind. They had the right amount of energy to deal with a hungover couple and still provided great conversation! I tried to offer him some of my beer as I just opened it but he refused... If I had a extra one in my room I would bring it down for when he is off his shift! Lol. This place really is a hole in the wall but exceeded my expectation! Props to your beer knowledge!!! Hope you make mad tips and get some hot chicks numbers!
1030	1	Exceptional!! From the minute we walked in until the minute we left. Amanda was our server and I would have to put her in out top 5 best experiences with a server. She was very sweet but very quick, efficient, and attentive. Definitely a great asset to the company. I don't normally post reviews but it is people like her that deserve recognition so I promised the general manager that I would do this. Great job Amanda!
1031	0	The only thing I give this place is for the location it's a nice place to visit. But the service and food was horrible. I would rather spend the money at a nicer place with better customer service. The waitress her name started with a "p" she was dismissive and she didn't really have a lot of tables (I've been a waitress before). It looked like everyone else was serving her food, she forgot things we ordered and bad customer service. At the end of lunch we decided to have dessert- but she ignored us and gave us the bill. I guess we won't stay dessert- both worth eating here. Please try to visit tatorria bakery service is fantastic and food is great!
1032	0	I should mention first and foremost, the Riviera is going to close soon. It will be demolished and turned into a convention center. Based on my latest experience there, they either deserve it or don't care because of it... My friends and I stayed here last year and had a much better time. That's why we chose to return. Unfortunately, the experience was very different.  My first example of this is no more real perks. They still offer a coupon book and "rewards" card, but the coupons don't amount to much and the rewards are a bit of a stretch to attain. The offer no specials for occasions. Which was disappointing since we went over my birthday. At the end of the day you get two uncomfortable (labeled double but actually twin) beds and that's about it.  The second issue I had was with the general staff. From the tables to the bartender to the housekeeping staff, no one really cares or shows any sort of initiative. Granted, I know they're shutting down, but if I worked for an establishment in the area, I wouldn't consider them for a position with that attitude or lack of work ethic. A few examples of this - when we requested a plunger for our bathroom because the toilet, which was running poorly from the start, stopped working - no one arrived. It took us over 3hrs to get service! When we went to the bar for a $1.00 (which turned out to be $1.50/+tax) drink our bill would constantly vary - even if it was the same exact order. The point of complaining or commenting was a waste of time. When dealing the sports booking area or general wait staff you'd receive the same nonchalant apology. Even if it was with management. It was honestly sad.  As for a amenities, you know going into if you're not getting much hospitality-wise. It's one of the cheaper places on the strip and that is known through advertising. The sad part is they have shut down tables that we were expecting play from last year and raised prices on certain products. The general ambiance on the casino is a bit grimy, but doable if you want to save the $10-20 per night for a slightly better casino/hotel.  For positives, I truly don't have much. It's fair priced to be "on the strip". In reality though, you still have walk a little more than a few blocks to start seeing what you want to see from The Strips image. The other thing I'll mention is two employees: Lany from the Cashier department & Adrienne who worked in table games. I hope I spelled their names correctly, and they deserve all the credit in the world. Amidst or less than average experience they, they remained pleasant, positive, and upbeat. Even to the fact their business would be closing, they are making the most of it. Good for them, and I sincerely wish them luck in the future.  I would say I don't recommend this place, but if truly doesn't matter. It won't be around much longer, and clearly it shows. I am sorry to those losing work and hope the new center offers new opportunities, but I have been born & raised to make the most of situations. To make a multi-hundred attendance of guests get poor service or feel like you're wasting their time because of external circumstances neither fair nor fun for anyone involved.
1033	0	I love burgers, so I really wanted to love I Love Burgers.  I loved the friendly hostesses.  I loved the friendly woman working at the counter.  I didn't love the over cooked, dry burger.  I didn't love the under cooked fatty bacon they slapped on my over cooked dry burger.  So five stars for the employees, but only 2 stars for the food.
1034	1	I can't say enough good things about this place. Gordon Ramsey has really nailed it here. Every time I come to Vegas (and lately it's been fairly often) I need to stop by here.  Their burgers are spot on. Well constructed, great selection of flavors. They don't overdo it with the toppings. Even though there are several burger options to choose from, they change up the toppings just enough to give unique burger experiences, but still let the flavor of the beef shine. My favorites so far are the farm burger and the Brittania burger, you can't go wrong with either. Only downside is that the burgers are $15+. Whatever, worth it.  Where BurGR really shines though, is in the sides and shakes. Their truffle fries are the best fries I've ever had and their jalapeo poppers are out of this world. The Oreo milkshake is unlike anything I've ever seen before. Oreo milkshake, creme brle, whipped cream, and an Oreo cookie in top. Jesus take the wheel.
1035	1	Second location I've been to, still my favorite and best breakfast choice.  Our server was most helpful, she described how they did things around there: fresh and quality ingredients, super large portions served on platters, and the trick to avoiding the "share charge." The food is too much for one person, so if you share without the other person ordering at least a side, they charge an extra $2.50. Still worth it despite that stipulation.  The flapjcks can be split between a family of four and cut like a pizza, its ridiculous. The smoked salmon hash is the way to go, its an overwhelming first bite. Their house made strawberry jam is delicious on their biscuits.  Its larger than the San Diego location, so luckily on a Friday morning my party of five did not have to wait at all.  They also serve lunch and dinner, check out the website for the menu.
1036	1	Ate there for lunch today.  The food was so amazing!  The fried rice and sour pork appetizer was a bit spicy for my wife, but I found it delectable.  We also had the crispy duck with drunken noodles, the title speaks for itself!  Service was great, and it was not busy as we hit at the end of the lunch rush.  I'll be sure to go back next time I'm in town!

1038	0	If I could give this place zero stars I would. My group and I were not expecting a 5 star dining experience walking into Cabo Wabo but what we weren't expecting was  to be so dissatisfied before our food even came. Our server recommended the specialty Cabo Wabo margarita because it's " made in house" and the other marg was basically a mix. So we ordered some pitchers and then some chips and salsa. When the chips and salsa and drinks came we were so hungry we dove right in. The salsa tasted like burnt cigarettes, and the margaritas were the worst I have ever had. Too sour and soooo watered down. Mind you pitchers were $45 so we were expecting something much better. We decided we didn't even want to give the food a chance (I had previously heard a table behind us talking about how horrible the food was.) We asked to cash out and got out of there as fast as we could. I will compliment the manager for only making us pay $30 for a $100 bill. Yes $100 for horrible chips/salsa and margaritas. We then headed over to HEXX which was amazing and a much better experience.
1039	0	I want to give more stars because the Chinese food is surprisingly good and authentic. Noodles are a must try! But the service is just SO damn bad. It was an hour wait (but I saw so many empty tables). Good thing I could go waste some time and money in the casino while waiting.   The hostesses at the front were rude and incompetent. The specific server I had was slow and rude as well. We ordered tomato egg noodles, scallion pancakes, and dumplings. We got the first two dishes and finished those and sat waiting around for the dumplings. FINALLY she came to us and told us the dumplings came apart while cooking. Okay...???????? Like wtf LOL and she expected us to just cancel the order. But we said we still wanted it, and she seemed annoyed.  Very pricey.
1040	0	This review is for the management and the bouncers.  Let me tell you a story.  I just flew into Las vegas, had a nice dinner with friends from out of country that I haven't seen in a very long time.  Then we decided to go to the night club that was in our hotel the Venetian.  I believe it was around 3:00AM when something terrible happened.  A random dude comes out of nowhere and punches me in the back of the head.  At the time I was dancing with my friends on the dance floor.  I was not in anyone's way and wasn't even interacting with anyone outside my group.  So the punch hit's me in the back of my head and my glasses.  So I look at the guy that did this to me and ask him "What the fuck are you doing?"  and he just says "Fuck you blah blah blah".  Then the bouncers come out of nowhere and grab ME!!! NOT HIM! BUT ME!!! forcefully as if he assumed I was the one who started the commotion.   I was guilty of giving a man a finger but only after I was assaulted and lost my glasses.    As I was being grabbed and pushed backwards outside some side exit I try to tell the bouncer who has his vice grip on me that I did not do anything and that I am blind without my glasses (I'm -7.5 in both my eyes) and I need to get my glasses.  He ignores me and when we are outside acts like he does not give a single fuck about what I am saying.  Again I repeat to him for the 5-6 times that I really need my glasses and I would gladly leave the premises ASAP if they would just let me look for my glasses.    He continues to ignore what I am saying until he pushes me outside.  He the asks for my ID.  So I give it to him.  In my mind I assume he was filing some kind of incident report (but this was not the case since I called back the next day and there was no evidence of the incident happening according to management/security).  So why did he take my name down?  Why did he need my id?    Then the bouncer has the audacity to blame me for his broken watch, like really?  How could that have been when I did not resist you and you had my by both my arms so tight that it left bruises on my body.  Yes people bruises, and yes I do have pictures.  I was shocked that he would handle someone so fiercely even though I did not assault anyone nor threatened him in anyway.   So I tell him I didn't do shit to your watch and I really need to get my glasses.  Another bouncer comes in and tells the bouncer who threw me out of the club for being hit in a head by someone else to go look for the glasses.  That bouncer leaves and the other bouncer says something like "we are trying to run a business and we are trying to end this disturbance...." So at this point I was really angry.  I continue to explain what happened and that I really need my glasses since this is the 1st night of my vacation and not having sight really puts a jam on things.   Talking to this guy proved useless much like the last bouncer.   So the bouncer that threw me out comes back after 3-5 minutes of "searching" for my glasses and says I'm shit out of luck.  They get my number and escort me out of the club and simply say "if we find your glasses, we will contact you."  So end of the night, nothing happens to my attacker and I lose sight and I don't get so much as a sorry for the bouncer's behavior.    So I later that night I file a report with the Venetian Security.  There was supposed to be a representative from Tao present at the time of the incident but I was told by the Venetian front desk that they will not be coming.  More proof of zero fucks given by Tao security and management.    I call the next day to security office and I file a report supposedly with one of the girls there, since there was no report failed from the next before.  They say they will send a email to the "Director Victor" who runs the show at Tao.  I am told I can only have someone from Tao email him because it is impossible to reach this "Director Victor" by any other means.  Really?  Really?  Okay let's just believe in that bullshit.  They did ask me what kind of outcome I would like to see happen.  I mentioned my trip is essentially fucked so that was worth a couple of thousand to me and my glasses was worth around six hundred but I did repeat multiple times that the money is not as important to me as getting my sight back.    So a day goes by I call them again and again I ask them to contact "Director Victor" by email since there is no other way he communicates.  More days go by..  no answer.  So I'm back in NY now and still no answer after a couple of weeks.   So "Director Victor" thank you for making Tao so memorable for me.  They way your people conduct security and the way you do business is something I will keep near and dear to my he
1041	1	We almost didn't try this place but I am so happy we did! Possibly because I had this thought in my head that Thai food can't be much different from the many places that we already tried back home in Hawaii...or maybe it was because my friend who introduced us to some of our favorite Thai food places back home didn't care for this place much.  I am so glad that we ended up here regardless of the reasons pointing elsewhere because I really really enjoyed it. Since they are   LOCATED near the airport (South side of the strip). It was convenient and the timing was right.   FOOD - GREAT - We always order the same food items when trying a new Thai restaurant for the first time. It's basically so I can compare the taste. It's also our favorite dishes.   Egg Roll/Spring Roll - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lotus-of-siam-las-vegas?select=lEMdN1ShZ1X41uUUg83JTQ#30s9CUJHF-BaOe0FWkX9nQ I asked for Spring Roll and he said they call it egg roll here. This confused me as I always thought that Vietnamese and Thai call theirs spring rolls but he said they don't use the rice paper wrap. Didn't matter, I enjoyed it. Rice paper wrap, egg dough..whatever... it came out hot, it was crispy and had great filling.   Pad Thai Noodle W/Chicken - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lotus-of-siam-las-vegas?select=lEMdN1ShZ1X41uUUg83JTQ#skkyJU6psgsiM0M_AqMO9g I was very impressed with this dish. The noodles did not stick together, it was not too oily, and it had a very rich and strong peanut flavor. It also had the right amount of acidity to balance out the richness. This was one of the better pad Thai dishes that I have eaten.   Panang Curry W/Beef - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lotus-of-siam-las-vegas?select=lEMdN1ShZ1X41uUUg83JTQ#LhgLajbztEVV4jVr_ggEvQ We normally order panang curry or yellow curry but lately we been choosing panang more than yellow. Probably because panang is richer and creamier in flavor, and that is exactly what we got with this dish. They don't give a lot but you don't need a lot since this dish is packed with flavor.    Spice levels are based on a scale of 1-10 and we got level 7. This is about as high as I would like it to go here. Any higher and it would have probably killed the taste for me.   The ENVIRONMENT here was very pleasant. Although it was very crowded, we didn't feel claustrophobic because they have lots of tables and are properly spaced out. The size of this place is a pretty decent size. We were even able to bring in our stroller.   The SERVICE is good. As soon as we entered our hostess took us to a table to accommodate our stroller. A huge plus in my book. Our server also had proper knowledge and took care of us in a timely manner. I just wish he would have been a little happier but I can't dock them just on that.   The OVERALL price for the quality of food here is totally worth it. I enjoyed the entire experience and I have to give this place 5 stars.
1042	0	Im not going to lie this is one of the most expensive asian resturants ive been too. but it was something different from the fast food, americam and buffet we were having in vegas. i loved the design of the resturant! very different compared to lots of other asian resturant you'll go too. expect to put out about 18-22 dollars for each plate or so for a small portion. Food was served out fast but tasted okay! serving was great!
1043	0	I stayed in the Mediterranean Tower on a Thursday until Sunday at The Riveria. There wasn't a refrigerator in our room, the room didn't come stocked with all of the essentials for travel, the TV service in the room is lacking (HDTV with no HD and lousy low def lodgenet service), and we had two rooms we had booked to be next to each other, but they were not able to make this happen. However, the casino is very nice and the staff is very friendly, and there's a nice pool and a tattoo shop along with other shops. Just take note that the Mediterranean Tower is inexpensive, so expect to be a bit underwhelmed. The one thing that made my 3 star rating a 2 star was the unavailability of WiFi, which is crucial for someone like me. The WiFi was working great on our first night's visit, but then the WiFi network dropped off early the next day on my and my friend's devices, and I was unable to log on with my laptop computer. Certainly the hotel can provide better coverage, especially for someone who might have to remotely connect into work in the case of an urgent matter, and it would have also been nice to play music on too. Of course I was in an inexpensive part of the hotel, but I wouldn't stay at a hotel that didn't have reliable WiFi. I called the front desk to complain and they thanked me for reporting it, but unfortunately we were unable to get back on the WiFi network in my and my friend's room, and we were a good distance apart. I hate to say it, but I don't think I would stay at this hotel unless I was given a free night's stay in a better room with WiFi that will continue to work. Here's hoping they give me a chance to formulate a second opinion. ;-)
1044	1	One of the chefs I worked fro recommended this place to me when I visited Vegas. This place is just amazing! I'm not a huge fan of burgers but this burger joint is awesome! I love the fact that you can design your burger. The sweet potato are also great. You will not regret coming here!
1045	0	This is the first, and hopefully the last, 1 star review I posted on here.  First off, there is a sign right in front of the Buffet that says some prices in very large writing, so when you walk by the sign you think that is the 'real' prices (i think it says 17.99 during the week and 21.99 for the weekend).  But you have to look at the small print and see that it is on for 'to go' orders.  That threw us off right off the bat.  The real price is $31.00.  So they suckered us in with that sign and i wasn't happy about that.    Second, the food was blahhh.  Pretty much what you can get at a $9.99 buffet anywhere.  Some of the better things they had were all gone and when i asked how long it would take to cook them and for them to be available they told me 5 minutes.  15 minutes later they still weren't ready.  Plenty of other buffets to try in Vegas, dont waste your time on this one.
1046	1	11:30am arrival. Seated within 2 minutes. Promptly got drinks and assistance. Huge selection of food with smaller breakfast menu served all day. Prices were fantastic for being Las Vegas and more accustomed to what we are used to back home. Service was wonderful and great customers service. Instead of the traditional crayons and coloring for kids they gave these wax strips in multiple colors that kids could create objects with. Super cool and totally different fro. Any other restaurant. Our waiter gave us a few packets to take home as well.   We had to wait about 20 minutes for the food to come to our table but thinking about how big the menu is and the amount of people in the restaurant I can't really complain. It was not that bad. The proportions for the food are HUGE. So much food for the price.   If you are in the area and need a great meal for a fantastic price don't hesitate to try the Grand Luxe.
1047	1	The food was incredible. There are inside and outside seating options available. There is no reservations (first come first serve) but the wait was less than 5 minutes. The menu is excellent. The place is rated as $$$ but my wife and I ate an incredible meal for under 50 dollars. The corn beef hash is out of this world good. Probably the best i tasted so far. My wife ordered bread pudding which didn't disappoint either. The bacon was a separate charge of 5 dollars, but it was cooked to perfection. Most defiantly a place I would eat again.
1048	0	Overpriced and not at all comfortable. (hard chairs and laminate tables) We tried the buffalo and the angus. It gets two stars because I am a burger and hot dog aficionado. Nothin special about this place. Even the sweet potato fries and chips were ho hum. And what's in that stringy sticky dippin sauce?
1049	0	We got a Voucher to the buffet, decided to use it for breakfast thinking that people can't really screw up breakfast...and I was wrong! The donut holes were dry, orange juice luke warm, are the scrambled eggs real? The only good part of the breakfast was the bacon. Thank goodness it was all paid for by a voucher.
1050	1	If you come to Vegas, you gotta come to this place for brunch after a long night out on the town.  It is just so goddamn cool, it is ridiculous.  This is a restaurant that looks like a strip club on the inside.  Neon pink and blue lights everywhere and a lounge that makes you feel like you are in the heart of Dirty Vegas.  Fireside Lounge looks absolutely incredible.  I will be back!  I had a simple breakfast platter which was extremely filling and the portions were generous.  Having a separate cocktail waitress come around and offer you alcohol at 10 am was interesting too.  Not bad at all.  I will be making it back here on future Vegas adventures.  No doubt.
1051	1	This is our fist time try this place. The food was really good as well as the service. We order the Las Vegas combo with 2 appetizers, almost forget to mention they have happy house between 4pm-6pm. There's a lot of food share, we cant even finish it, so we take some home. I would recommend this place to our friends, and we definitely will return.
1052	0	With all the hype back in Cali about Pink's hot dogs, it was sort of weird to see that there is absolutely no ridiculous line to get myself a Chicago dog complete with all the trimmings.  As a fellow Chicago-ian, I'd say I've had my fair share of Chicago dogs and you know a good hot dog isn't good unless you have the right condiments/toppings to go with your dog.    I thought the Vegas version of Pink's was much more weak than the original location mainly because it feels absolutely cramped inside and you'll probably feel guilty for blocking the entrance trying to decide which hot dog you want. Once my bf finished holding up the line trying to find the RIGHT combination for his hot dog, we placed our order and got it within 5 minutes.  The hot dogs were pretty average and they loaded it up with tons of toppings which is nice, but my hot dog was missing out on a ton of ingredients that defines a Chi-town dog. What happened to the onions, tomatoes, and mustard on my hot dog, Pink's!? Instead I got lettuce, relish and a pickle. I'm hoping this was some sort of mistake, nonetheless we ate our food and and went on our way.
1053	1	Exquisite and just a phenomenal place to eat and dine out with that special someone. The experience was fantastic. The food, drinks, appetizers and the presentation were one of the best I have had on a long time. Located in the heart of the Venetian casino, we have a VIP experience all the way. The salad was perfectly dressed and seasoned. The stake and the seafood which were our main course for meal were prepared better than imagined. A little pricy but worth every penny.
1054	1	Great food.  Restaurant is a little loud.  The staff was attentive and knowledgable about the food.  I enjoyed the farm burger and onion rings.  Definitely a must next time I'm back in Vegas.  If you're in the mood for a good burger, give this place a try.
1055	0	Cafeteria style food. To say it was mediocre would be a compliment. Hands down, the worst buffet experience I've ever had. You're in Vegas! There's lots of good places to eat - avoid this place. You're better off eating at the food court in the Luxor.  If you actually enjoyed the food and selection here and thought it was actually good, you should get your taste buds examined. Seriously.
1056	1	I'll preface this review with the fact that I am NOT a breakfast person. I don't love anything about it. Except when I visit the Egg & I. And let me tell you ... it became a weekly event after a while.  I can't turn down fresh squeezed OJ. This restaurant has delicious OJ. You should try it at least once. I love their menu. They have interesting combinations, like chicken, pesto, and eggs, and delicious twists on common breakfast dishes, like French toast. I love the scrambles the most, and would  often get the veggie scramble sitting atop ranch potatoes. Slather that mound with hot sauce and call it a day. Expect an exhilerating food coma to follow. The portions are big. I also recommend trying their complimentary banana nut muffin at least once. I don't like muffins or bananas, seriously, but I like theirs. Be adventurous, don't order eggs and a side of bacon. Live it up a little...  Super awesome service. Expect to wait on the weekends for breakfast/brunch, but they have a quick turn-around and great waiters/waitresses. A nice perk to the crowded atmosphere is an egg on the table that you can flip when you require service. On a very busy day it's very helpful to the staff, and don't be afraid to use it! I've always had friendly, impeccable service here ... no complaints. I've brought every out-of-town guest here for breakfast, and we've always left happy. Stop in and give it a try!
1057	0	This experience was just blah.  My yardstick was really good but my margarita was just meh. The service was awful. Besides the yardsticks I really have nothing good To say about this place. It's Vegas you can get better drinks for a better price anywhere.
1058	0	Food quality: 1.5 out of 5 Price: 1 out of 5 Ambiance: 4 out of 5 Service: 1 out of 5  Highlights: Overpriced, mediocre Chinese food with bad service. You are better off going to Panda Express at the mall.  * * *   Okay. Let's preface this with the fact that I am an Asian American raised in a part of California where good Chinese restaurants can be found in unusually high concentrations. I'm used to my wonton noodle soups costing somewhere from $6 to $12, with excellent quality. I'm also used to service being spotty at Asian restaurants, so that isn't really unexpected.   My girlfriend and I came in for lunch, craving some tasty hot noodle soup. We sat down and got the beef brisket noodle soup and the pork wonton with chicken broth noodle soup. The Total Rewards pricing for each was $15.99. (Side note: Everyone should get Total Rewards pricing since it's free to get a card from the casino and works at half of the casinos on the strip.)  The price was already a little over the top from what I would pay for great noodle soup. But our craving was strong, and we knew our options were limited.   Sat down. Waited several minutes before anyone acknowledged us. Finally got our order in. Only took about 5 minutes for the food to come out.   The beef brisket noodle soup was oily beef broth. Not the kind you would want to drink a bowl full of. The noodles were not bad, the beef pieces were ok. Overall, the broth really killed the bowl for me, and the fact that it was a $16 bowl.   The pork wonton noodle soup had a lighter broth. It was definitely drinkable and tasty, but the wontons tasted really off. Like they weren't made out of pork. The noodles were the same house made ones. There was random pieces of seaweed and tiny dry shrimp. A weird mix but not completely surprising from an Asian bowl.   Overall, not worth the price or even worth visiting. You are honestly better off going to Panda Express.
1059	1	Don't judge a book by its cover. This place is amazing. The hostess took our name and told us it would be an hour wait. We sat at the bar, ordered drinks and appetizers and poured over the menu. Before we knew it 40 minutes had passed and we were being seated. The food and service were both impeccable. I loved the impressive feel of the restaurant, like a hidden gem
1060	1	Went here for the first time and it was great!  Dining experience - 5/5 I mean it's KBBQ/Yakiniku style so you cook everything yourself which is always fun and awesome because you can control how you want your beef/steak done   Taste- 5/5 they have a variety of meats/seafood/vegetables you could throw on the grill including Kobe style beef which just melts in your mouth  Cost-4/5 not bad the only pricey item was the Kobe style beef which is ok, could be a little cheaper (comes with 5-6 slices=$21.95) they also catch you on the little things you'd expect to be included with your meal (sauces, rice, etc. they do come with complimentary small side dishes like kimchi, mac salad, etc.)   All in all it was great! Also if you were to write a Yelp review you get a free desert!
1061	0	Tao Nightclub deserves this 1 star, but it's also getting 1 start to outweigh the review that my friend posted for a 4 star review.....but he can't count his experience!!!  He had an all expenses paid trip to LV and all drinks were paid for at Tao by Virgin Airlines and not to mention it was on a Wednesday night!!  Seriously!  Tao is COMPLETELY overrated.  The dance floor is tiny, there are columns in the way so you can't even people watch if you are one of the wall flowers, the bartenders (male and female) are REALLY bitchy and the service is terrible.  The millions of buddha faces start to look scarey after awhile and the atmosphere is stuffy.  No me gusta!  Pure is a MILLION times cooler than this place.  I went twice and haven't returned, I'll leave it for the celebrities who are paid to be there or my friends who get free trips to Vegas and free drinks at Tao! ;)
1062	1	Me: Bites into the burger Me: 0.0 Me: (does best impersonation of Gordon Ramsay) this burger is #$(@* AMAZING!  So how does BurGR stack up against other popular burger joints in Vegas? Here is my definitive list:  1) BurGR 2) Bachi 3) Holstein ..... 100000) Burger Bar  First off, the decor here is awesome. Who doesn't love live flames everywhere, especially in the middle of PH. It's pretty much, Hell's Kitchen. ;). Onto the food! The Euro burger was a hogwash blend of aromatic truffle aioli and goat cheese. Every bite was packed with savory flavors. Additionally, the truffle fries here are darn amazing. Thick cut and fried into crispy golden slices of heaven. My gf and I agreed that the Euro burger was one of the best burgers we've ever had!  Overall, my only complaints were the snotty server and long wait time to be seated and fed (45 minutes). She was not very friendly and she gave us attitude when we tried to use our total rewards card... However, even questionable service still doesn't compare to the impeccable food. Furthermore, the long wait only made us savor the food more.   If this is the kitchen in Hell... and Gordon Ramsay is the lord of the underworld... I'm fine with trading my soul for this burger. XD.
1063	1	Just for reference, I don't write 5 star reviews unless they're very well deserved.  But this place consistently rates high with us.  This was out third visit.  We recently visited Egg & I for breakfast with a group of six.  We arrived about 10:30 in the morning.  There was a considerable waiting line.  However, the hostess was very sweet and efficient. The estimated 20 minutes wait was actually more like 10 minutes.  Our waitress (sadly I didn't get her name) was incredible, attentive without being overbearing, quick and efficient.  Once our orders were taken, the food arrived fairly quickly, no mistakes or wrong items.  We pretty much all ordered something different.  I had the house made (not canned) corn beef hash and eggs.  Excellent.  Can't remember what everybody had but all raved about their food. Avoid the strip with it's lines and cheesy buffets and overpriced breakfasts and check this place out.  Just a short drive from the strip.  Mostly locals and a few visitors.  A gem!
1064	1	My fianc and I went here for the first time during late night happy hour. Our overall experience was 5 star worthy. We were seated right away and greeted with a smile. Happy hour menu is small but all items had good portions. Our favorite was the beef carpaccio. Must must try! We had the beef trop and pork toro was so juicy and flavorful. We'll definitely come here again in a few days heheh.
1065	1	Holy crap where do I start??? Tldr: if you're reading this, just go there as soon as you can.   We went on a Sunday morning, for a lazy brunch and that's exactly what it was.   The menu options are EXTENSIVE. Lots of sweet and savory options. We ordered the Brad's Scramble and Waffle with a banana nut muffin on the side. I'd read tons of reviews about the muffin so I wanted to know what the hype was all about.   And I was BLOWN AWAY. This is one of the yummiest, tastiest muffins I've had in my life. And this set the bar really, really high for me.   Then the waffle - with a nice layer of whipped cream and blueberries was perfect.   Scrambled eggs were great as well. The potatoes were really excellent! Cooked perfectly and coated with the Hablo Diabla spice, not too spicy - just right.   When we went to settle the check, there was a mixup and they charged us with someone else's bill. But they handled the situation well, and fixed the goof up very humbly.   The staff was always nice and sweet.   This is in stark comparison to the fancier places we dined over the weekend, where the staff was very curt and hostile at best.   Will definitely come back, just for those muffins awww man.
1066	0	We ate lunch there twice during our stay ... both times were just so-so.  I've read some of the previous reviews, and don't know what "variety" some of you are referring to.  I am not a picky eater but could only find a few items to eat.  My husband and I also received the 2 for 1 offer for the buffet.  Yes, it was cheaper than going to some of the other buffets but I really don't think it was worth the savings.  They had no seafood whatsoever during the week (for lunch or dinner ... we went in late for lunch and hung out for dinner).  The best thing about the place was their fresh salad bar where they make the salad any way you like.  The desserts were awful ... minus the homeade powdered donuts which were excellent.  Would I come back again?  No way.  We went to the buffet in Harrah's and spent less than what we did at the buffet in TI (with a 2 for 1 coupon) and it was delicious.  If you wait around until it's lunch time they will serve prime rib, peel and eat shrimp, ham, etc.
1067	1	So there is a reason why everyone raves about the beef wellington,  it is so tender, soft and delicious it is my new favorite food.  I took my husband here for his bday and had one of the best dining experiences. The staff was friendly and very knowledgeable.  The food was phenomenal,  but you do have to like truffle oil to fully enjoy everything.   I would highly recommend this restaurant.
1068	1	Shogun burger was DELICIOUS. The seared foie was so buttery and went so well with the poached Asian pear. I asked to have my burger cooked mid-rare and it was perfectly cooked.  Kiki burger and Mr. Ho's burger were also very good.   Also got the oxtail chili fries. Personally, I thought the beans in the chili were just barely undercooked but it was awesome besides that and three of us killed the plate.    Service was great. Even though the place was packed, someone was always making sure our water was filled and we had everything we needed.
1069	0	March 25th, 2011  Ordered:  Special Sandwich  Ham/Cheese Croissant  Iced Coffee  Deep Fried Balls covered w/ Seasame (I don't know the name ha)  Fried Egg Rolls  Pros: * awesome layout.. The biggest Lee's I've seen! * Lots of free samples to try. * express line available for strictly pastries and coffee orders * They have a room available for banquets and private affairs.  Cons: * Rock Hard baguette bread ! * Minimal selection of asian sandwiches * congested with traffic. * I order deep fried pastries for dessert and they threw it in the same bag as my fried egg rolls.. who does that??  Tips: * Go down the street to Mr. Sandwich * I'm not a coffee fan, but its strong and good according to my gf * easy on the ice for the ice coffee would be a most wise request.    Okay, so I came during grand opening and ribbon cutting, which explains the crazy traffic (but I attempted to come again a few days later and it was still busy so I opted for good ol' Mr. Sandwich).  I've had Lee's before in California and remember taking a liking to it, but man their baguette's are just super hard!  The express lane was nice for those coffee drinkers and pastry lovers, but I was here for sandwiches.  The disappointing thing is that they tried to have a diverse palette of sandwiches by throwing in american sandwiches (ham and cheese) on croissant bread.  If I wanted an American sandwich, I'd go to Subway (or better yet Port-O-Subs).  The option of American sandwiches was interesting at first, but it isn't even tasty. Sure this added diversity, but it also limited their selection of Eurasian sandwiches.  I understand Lee's is a big name and the opening ceremony was a blast, but it just didn't win me over.  Will I be back?  Sure, but only because I got a free $5.00 gift card for coming during the grand opening.  Aside from that, I'm good with Hue Thai's or Mr. Sandwich for my Asian Sandwich cravings.
1070	0	Not.good.period.    A group of 4 of us came here at about 10am for the breakfast buffet on a Wednesday and it was VERY underwhelming!!! It looks like maybe it would have been okay for lunch or dinner with all the different food around the world stations, but for breakfast it was just the same stuff and over again which would have been okay I guess if the food they had wouldn't have been so nasty.  The eggs were old and rubbery, the bacon was practically raw, the pancakes tasted like cardboard and the little mcmuffin type things had bread SO HARD I think I chipped a tooth. My friend got a danish and he hit it with a fork and it made a sound like a hockey puck. The quiche and crepes were no better.  We all ordered an array of drinks and the waitress managed to mess that up. Also, the hot chocolate was disgusting and the coffee wasn't much better. She was not very good and I got a rude vibe from her.   $20 per person seemed WAY over priced for what they offered. I will NEVER go here again for breakfast, and honestly, I think I'd skip it for anything else as well and go somewhere else like The Rio which I know to be amazing.
1071	0	For some reason I always here people raving about Tao.  Maybe it just wasn't the right night when I went?  Thank goodness I didn't pay to get in- my girl and I got hooked up by one of the promoters running around.  We were ushered in right away which is great because I hate waiting in line.    The place was so croweded we could barely move through.  The masses of people surrounding the bar spilled into the dancefloor area.  Everyone was drunk and falling all over each other.  The main dancefloor area is also sunken and I managed to slip on one of the two steps down (c'mon, ladies are in four inch heels! steps?!?!).  The suuuper high ceilings may appeal to some people but it just felt like a warehouse to me.  I don't know, I just didn't like it.
1072	0	Three things: 1. Our server was very kind (black chick). 2. Another server was a bitch, rolling her eyes at our request for new utensils, since we received dirty ones (blonde chick). She did not grant our request. 3. Wings were below average. It filled me up, but did not satisfy.
1073	1	I stopped at Holsteins for lunch today........I grabbed a seat at the bar and decided to order the Nom Nom Burger.  Its a Burger with a Kobe Beef Patty, Potato Chips, Fried Egg, Cheese and Thousand Island Dressing.  When the Burger arrived, it looked awesome.....the Kobe Beef Patty was huge and the Bun was just the right size.....about 1/2 inch smaller than the patty.  One bite and I was in Heaven....so juicy and full of beef flavor.  The Shoestring Fries was good.....and the two bartenders was freaking HOT!!  In fact.....all around me were HOT GIRLS!  A great Burger and HOT GIRLS!  I love this place!
1074	0	Rooms are decent and the beds are VERY COMFY! Free access to the pool and amenities when we went.  Downside: Our toilet was spewing like a geyser and we saw a humungo roach crawl across the floor. Called maintenance/front and they acted like we should've expected it....that was after the 3rd call to them. WOW!  Tip: Try the raspberry mojito at the pool bar. The 2 for 1 drink specials are gonna get you snockerbockered!
1075	1	Had so much fun at Lotus of Siam - a unique experience when compared to the celeb-chef loaded, overpriced spots on the strip that's definitely worth the cab ride out.  It's low-key, no need to get dressed up, and they're dead serious about reservations - will only hold your table for 5 minutes. Obviously, they're masters of tom yum soup - and any other variety.  I ordered mine mild, because I'm a baby, and they obliged - but one of my companions ordered "insane spicy" and they certainly did that too - he was in a lot of pain.  The crispy rice with pork and scallions absolutely rocks - one of my favorite thai dishes I've ever tried.  Broad drunken noodles, red curry, and a whole fish rounded out the meal.  Such a fun experience, highly recommended.
1076	1	I've been to the Egg & I several times, and each time breakfast has been great.  Went once with my wife and I and sat outside and enjoyed one of their excellent scrambles and a delicious benedict, both of which we really enjoyed.    The second visit was this past weekend with my parents and brother and sister in law.  Food and service were both fantastic.  I had the chicken and chorizo breakfast burrito, while others enjoyed the cordon bleu skillet, a chorizo skillet, a french dip sandwich with cajun fries and an eggs benedict.  Everyone thoroughly enjoyed their food, which was brought very quickly given how packed the place was - talk about an efficient kitchen.  Our cups (water and coffee) never ran dry and the waiter struck the perfect balance between leaving us be to enjoy our meals and making sure we got what we need.  Will definitely be back in the future to this outstanding place.  Love it!
1077	0	So i went to this place for my birthday... my expectations were set high and sadly it did not meet. I assumed the meals would be large in portions and the prices to me neutral but was the complete opposite. The food was not that good especially for the prices. I did enjoy the decor though! ALSO the "frozen hot chocolate" was a let down i expected different.
1078	1	Ok no joke, this probably the best burger spot on the strip.  Located inside the Cosmo, Holstein serves some some burgers unlike anywhere else. To start off, the place looks awesome, I sure they spent alot of money here (as they did on everything in the Cosmo) and it shows. There is plenty of street art, anime style graphics, along that old-world leather feel in the dining area. Its definitely falls into the stylish chic category. Plus that giant cow by the entrance looks cool!   Now for the food, its awesome. Everyone tries out the Gold Standard and for good reason - cheddar, arugula, garlic chive aoili all make for a awesome burger. My personal fave:  is the Rising Sun - juicy, perfectly cooked kobe beef burger with crispy yam, teriyaki glaze and spicy mayo, and tempura avocado!.  The shakes are delicious (they do have alcohol in em) with the best one being Drunken Monkey. All of the bamboozled shakes have alcohol but you can get virgin as well. Try one out, they are delicious!  But be warned ahead of time, its not cheap, nor quiet. For a burger, fries and shake you are easily going come out spending $30+. Come in on a monday or weekend and the place be packed and loud from everyone trying to get inside of Marquee.
1079	0	Me and my friend stayed her for NYE 2010...let's just say I checked my self for mysterious bites as I returned home. There was nothing special about the room. The interior of hotel, hallways, casinos, and room felt old. The only thing they had improved, in my opinion, was a coat of paint. Which was applied over 35 year old paint.  I would never stay here again and it closely compared to my stay at the Travel Lodge, which was expected because it was a Travel Lodge and I paid for that level of comfort, or lack there of.
1080	1	Atmosphere 4/5 Service 4/5  Food 5/5: Country Natural medium rare with: Portabello mushroom Carmelized onion Onion bun  --Juiciest and most flavorful burger, in comparison to other highly rated burger joints like: The Counter, Kuma's Corner, Fatburger, Fuddruckers, Five Guys, In and Out.
1081	1	Taking into account location, comparable places nearby, pricing, and of course the quality of food, it is impossible to rate this place any lower than 5 stars. Really cool place that makes you feel as if you've stepped out of the Cosmopolitan and into any hole-in-the-wall pizza across America. The pizza was great, but the real winner for us was the cheesecake. $4.50 for a giant piece that easily feeds two hungry people. There was no line when we went (around noon on New Years Eve). The ONLY complaint was there being nowhere to sit, but even that isn't a big deal since there is seating everywhere in the Cosmo.
1082	0	I stayed here once before, no trouble, beautiful rooms. I booked with easy click travel. No where on my invoice was I alerted to the surprise resort fee of $15 per night.  After a long night of travel I simply asked to talk to a manager in the morning.   If I don't pay the surprise charge I don't get keys.   Don't ever stay here for any reason.  Thank Rodney and Darcie.
1083	1	Everything was EGGtastic. The long wait was worth it. All of the staff are super friendly and Alexa was awesome. She was very nice and attentive. I ordered the Chicken, Mushroom and Spinach and enjoyed it very much. My boyfriend for the must-haves stuffed French toast and he thought it was great. Make sure to check-in on Yelp to get the complimentary banana nut muffin.
1084	0	I was at a Tableau Software Conference in October of 2015 with 10,000 other data nerds. Great conference, but the MGM was just Ehhh, compared to Seattle and Washington D.C. where the previous 2 conferences have been.  It was cool seeing the Keynote speeches in the same arena that the big fights were that could hold 10,000 people.  The food was so fantastic at the other two places, the very mediocre meals were a little disappointing. For breakfast it was always a breakfast sandwich with egg and a protein and fresh fruit. Cereal and yogurt and stuff too, but I just wanted the vat of scrambled eggs I could take a nice couple of scoops of. Their beer was either Bud, Bud Light, or Heineken. Nothing really too special. They did have a special craft beer on the first night, but it was kind of gross I thought, and I like Pale Ales. For lunch it was more just normal buffet stuff. I realize that feeding 10,000 people is tough, but knowing what other places have done makes me greedy. How about a guy carving roast beef at the end of each lunch line? Anything special. This was just "Food" I have been to a ton of places that have had a lot better mass produced food.  They get you with a lot of nickel and dime stuff. Be prepared to spend an extra $45 every night for taxes and "Resort Fees" which is basically, free wi-fi. The pools were all closed. Pretty lame. Actually, VERY LAME! $25 for Wi-Fi?!?  I paid $189 for a room. It was like a cruise cabin room. Super small. Plus I was looking out over the HVAC system. Not good times. I was hardly in there more than 8 hours to sleep, but it was CRAZY small. Especially for that price. For $25 dollars a night resort fee, how about taking a week's worth of resort fees and throwing a mini fridge in each room? Nope, if you want a fridge, $25 a night. What a rip off.  The place is huge though. You get lost often and it would be nice if there were a ton more maps around the place. You could spend ten minutes walking around just trying to get back out to The Strip.  The service there was great though. Super nice people.  Just really really overpriced for what you get, especially when they are fleecing you at every restaurant and bar.
1085	0	Nasty!!!  Our first experience here was when they first opened...its was good! Food was good, customer service was good. This time its completely different. Burns gross fries, horrible nasty "customer" service, sent the fries back to only get back-talk from one of the employees!! Who does that!!! I'm guessing poor management is to blame? I'm not sure. The only thing good was the sliders!
1086	1	Ladies and Gentlemen we have a winner!  The Hines' have awarded the Gordon Ramsay BurGR the winner of the best burger challenge. Yes, it's not in Southern California, but this burger has me wanting to jump on a plane at midnight for a juicy bite.   The jalapeno poppers were delish and the surprise* popper added excitement to our evening. *one jalapeno still has the seeds inside adding some mystery and  heat to dish  To be fair in our process we ordered a beef burger, cheese, grilled onions, lettuce and tomato, although the other burger options were very tempting! The burger arrived hot, and smelling amazing. The meat was cooked perfectly and when cut in half was just barely manageable to get my mouth around for a bite. Each bite was every so tasty and not one ounce of grease dripped down my arm. The bun is great and you don't end up with no meat and all bun at the end. The Just Fries were more then enough for us to split and were overshadowed by the tasty burger, but from what I remember tasted pretty good as well.  Yes, the burgers are expensive, but 1, it's Vegas and 2, it's Gordon Ramsay.  *Not sure they take reservations, but if they do, I STRONGLY suggest making one, otherwise look at a 1hr wait, minimum. I wanted to stand out front after we were done telling people the wait was worth it. But hey, if you have a wait, wander around the Miracle Mile of Shops :)
1087	0	This place was gross and dirty. The waitstaff/hostesses were kind of rude and gave us the run around on how to get a table/how long it would take to wait (they had plenty of open tables but made us give our phone number and told us to wait 25 mins for a text and then come back, we got the text 30 seconds later LOL whatever). I've been to the real location in New York and this one is nothing like it. The decor is rundown and ratty and the place is DIRTY. I'm talking visibly grimy (picture the cleanliness of an older McDonalds). Both my food and my companion's food were gross. Please spare yourself the somewhat high price and go somewhere else (if you're craving breakfast food later in the day, there's a great waffle place across the street by Bally's). I gave 2 stars because nothing terrible actually happened but it was very bad.
1088	0	I've been in here three times and forgot my lesson from the first trip.  First off, this typifies overpriced Strip-located establishments.  Bloody Mary at $12 was okay but very stripped down and equipped with just 2 olives, not a lot of effort or attempt to favorably impress.  Minimum ingredients.  The steak fajitas were about like Applebee's but at about $24. Again fairly basic and no attempt to be anything special or remarkable, just overpriced.  There are a number of TV's well spaced around to watch football or the NCAA basketball opening rounds.  It is located right off the sidewalk on the Strip, and adjoins the Monte Carlo casino, with a coffee shop next to it.  At night this place really cranks up the music loud, I mean so it's difficult to hear the person next to you.  The bar is in the middle and has a clinical stainless steel appearance and feel, although the other patrons are usually friendly and the bartender did a good job.  The waiting staff were pretty disinterested to seat me or pay anything but minimal attention to me during my last stay, which was at 11:00 a.m. opening with very few other customers.  Good fajitas but not special, below par cocktail, cold staff, and a $40+ tab for one.  Probably won't go in again although I usually stay right there in the Monte Carlo Hotel.
1089	0	So after 10 years it ends with you people are no longer welcome in the restaurant?  Wow  what an insult, funny two weeks ago when we ate there three times in one week with no issues there was not a problem but last night when there was an issue with the food we are no longer welcome???  Why is there a manager at our table almost every time we eat there you ask?? Because they know us, we go there at least 5 - 10 times a month to eat and yes they come over to see how we are not because there was an issue.   I will definately miss the nice folks who work there but if I am not welcome anymore  there are plenty of other places to eat and gamble in Vegas who will benefit from the added business
1090	1	I will have to say this place has provided me the best steakhouse experience ever.  First thing you notice about this place is that the picture of the chef is not plastered all over the walls which is a great thing.  Let start will the bread that is given, 3 distance tasting breads with a butter that is quite a one of the kind taste.  Beef Wellington is incredible due to the fact that is it so flavorful inside the pastry it is cooked in.  Of course the sticky toffee pudding is really something that has be ordered.  It is really a dessert that you cannot find anywhere else.
1091	0	1- Loud, had to be the loudest restaurant I have ever been to. 2- Food, on par with Chili's or Applebee's, nothing special. 3- Service, waiter was nice but very rushed and stressed. 4- View, the view is excellent if you can get it. Personally I will not go back again.
1092	0	DO NOT EVER EVER EVER CONSIDER STAYING HERE! it's cheap but it needs to be closed down. One thing is saving money another is putting up with the worst when your trying to enjoy Vegas. I know you think I'll barely be in the room try taking a shower in s tub that's clogged & the water not being able to be adjusted things broken dirty smelly. Elevators hVd tagging no a/c in the hallways it's a DISASTER!! Circus circus is probably better then this and that's a Hot mess itself ! SHOP AROUND BALLYS FLAMINGO ETC .....
1093	1	This place is AWESOME! We ALWAYS come here when we visit Vegas! I always get the same burger (the Hangover Burger, which, I describe as a 'higher-end IN-N-OUT Burger). I also LOVE the salted caramel martini!   The service is ALWAYS excellent and they are always friendly!   I really can't say enough good things about this place. It's definitely worth a visit!
1094	0	This place was a disappointment.  The wife and I decided to give this place a try after seeing it on the Food Network.  Although the restaurant and walk up area was empty, it took a half an hour to get our order.  We got the ice cream sundae and frozen hot chocolate.  It was pricey and way too sweet.  I understand that the desserts here are supposed to be super rich and decadent, but this was overkill to the point that it was inedible.  We probably ate a quarter of our order and threw the rest away.  Also, would it kill you guys to wipe down the outdoor seating once in a while?  Everything was sticky and attracting bugs.
1095	1	Dear Secret Pizza,  Everytime I visit you I think of you for weeks after; and long for a pizza to live up to your amazing-ness here at home in the bay area.  it doesn't matter how long the line is- this is the best pizza on the strip and its 100% worth the wait; the hype is real; there is no struggle, just grab a beer and wait in line.  the white pizza- is unforgettable nomnom
1096	1	Let me get to the point! Burger bar rocks and i'm glad they have one in SF.  I wonder if its just as good..  We ordered the kobe beef burger with skinny fries and a side order of jalapeno beer battered pickle spears.  Good laaaaaaaaaaaawd! I was in heaven, such a great burger, super crisp and well seasoned fries and damn those pickle spears!!    Addicted...
1097	1	It's no secret that I'm not really a fan of pizza but once I tried the ones here... Oooooohhhh man... I'm in love! Every bite tastes like heaven. I had the cheese w/ mushroom pizza and my belly was dancing in joy! My husband and I loved it so much that we purposely forgot our diet and went for another round!
1098	0	I only ate here because it came free with our room (and with unlimited drinks at the west wing bar...woohoo!)   I agree with lots of others here, its not the best but not the worst either...but definitely not worth the money they ask for.  If you get this place comped or free, then COOL! You can never go wrong with omelets and bacon for breakfast or mashed potatoes and fried chicken and salads for dinner.  Don't expect much from this buffet and don't pay full price either. Studio B buffet is half the cost and WAY better.   Pros: -Convenient if you're staying at the hotel and can get comped for it, you'll be seated quicker -Has solid buffet basics:fresh green salads and veggies, potatoes and chicken...if you don't go fancy you'll be okay.  Cons: -The "fancier" items looked really suspect to me.  -Super busy and kinda nuts in there. Didn't really like the traffic in and around this buffet.
1099	0	MGM is ok I guess and navigating throughout the casino could have been thought out a lot better. In my opinion placing the floor map of the casino could have been in a better location such as when you first come in after parking your car, you have to find the map buried within the casino. Also they have a horrible potpourri smell in the lobby area and beyond. I'd advise if you have breathing issues or not really a custom to a very heavy fragrant to plant type materials I would try and avoid this area as much as you can, especially kids with breathing health issues.
1100	1	The wait was like an hour long. This place was packed. The good thing about it was that they'll text you when your table is ready. So you can walk around the Miracle Mile shops until your table is ready.  After finally getting a seat, I really liked the design of the place. The tables were all set up really nicely (the two seaters all in the middle). Gordon Ramsey's picture on the wall though was kind of over the top (at least that's what I thought). No need to promote yourself, we're already in your restaurant. Promote the food.  I don't remember what burger I got, but it was pretty good. I remember I kept thinking so that's what a "gourmet" burger looks like and taste like. It was a bit pricey but not too much. We also ordered fries. Please note you can order 1 fries for 2 people as 1 order will be enough. It comes with 2 dipping sauces I believe.  When I'm in Vegas and I'm not eating at one of the buffets, I'd probably come eat here again.
1101	0	I was a big fan of Noodles when it first opened so I made it a point to come back this weekend and try it again.  Maybe I'm spoiled from all the noodles I've tried since that first time or maybe I have learned enough in my dining adventures to determine what is good and what is bad.  In the end it was like a bad relationship. The problem wasn't that I changed the problem was just them.  The place was busy as most places were the weekend of the Pacquiao fight. We both ordered the beef brisket noodle soup and an order of shrimp dumplings. My friend who enjoyed most of the dumplings said they were ok but nothing to rave over. We both agreed the broth of the soup was too rich. Even with the addition of salt, pepper, and hot sauce we couldn't cut the richness of the soup.  I hoped that the noodles would save the dish but they were bland and flavorless. They seemed to be overcooked as it didn't compliment the broth at all.  The brisket came in really large pieces that were too tough for a soup so they had to be broken up by fork and knife.  The bok choy was probably the best compliment to the soup.  Service was like a stereo Chinese restaurant.  We couldn't understand our waitress and had a tough time flagging her down. We tried to get assistance from bus people but they refused always stating we had to go to the our waitress for everything. Look I don't mind keeping the place traditional but it's Vegas good service is expected as the prices we pay demand it. Especially if the food is overpriced.   In the end like the relationship I mentioned before it was like returning to an old girlfriend for me. You realize why you haven't gone back in a while. It was a nice attempt at re-kindling a memory of a great meal from my past but as time would have it people change and so do restaurants.
1102	0	Not a horrible buffet....but not a great one. There is a lot of variety to choose from...but the food isn't the greatest. The atmosphere is great and the service is wonderful. The dessert bar need MUCH help. Not a lot to  choose from there and most of it was horrible. I go to Vegas every year and usually steer clear of this one.
1103	0	Can't believe I haven't reviewed this place! When I first began coming to Vegas (around 2006), this was my absolute favorite buffet! I mean, it was a must each time my boyfriend and I went to Vegas (2x year).  It USED TO have such fresh food and variety and such amazing dessert selections....  What a darn disappointment these last couple of times and this last time just threw me over the top.  The food has become merely edible but oh so tasteless and hardly any fresh food! I mean, we pay for dinner price yet we eat the same crap as you served lunch hours ago? Uh, I don't think so.   and CUPCAKES and COTTON CANDY? ARE YOU KIDDING ME? What a cop-out! Those aren't real desserts, give me a break. Omg let me mention their crepes.... are pre-made and the cook just heats it and stuffs it for you! If you can't make it fresh, don't offer it!  Will never ever come here again.  They ought to get rid of their "Voted Best Buffet in Vegas" from 2006 because it sure as heck does not apply anymore.
1104	0	It's hard to give a bad review to something that was free.  But, here goes.  The food just is not good.  It's all siting in a vat of oil, and it's a weird mix of who knows what.  Almost every single vegetable was coated in cheese. I mean, I  like cheese, probably even more than the average person, but there are certainly better ways to prepare vegetables.  Even the breads were not that good, stale, and I couldn't even find the butter.  There were not any 'make your own' type stations - pasta, omlette - and the carver had duck and ham (where's the prime rib?).  The only upside was the soft serve ice cream machine - can never go wrong with soft serve with hot fudge and sprinkles.
1105	0	The atmosphere is decent here. I came in with a group of 9 girls and after waiting an hour we were seated on a fairly empty patio.   The food here was just really not good. I had the fried eggs Benedict and eating it was a chore. If I weren't starving and already seated I would have walked over to McDonald's. Between the 9 of us, we passed around each plate trying to find an edible bite. It was a challenge. We also had an order of the French toast and it was a burnt loaf of bread... Save your money and blow it at some other Vegas joint.  And GOD FORBID you want a water. You'd have to lick out of the toilet or go to the fountains at Caesars.
1106	0	I was a little bit disappointing as I've heard so many great things about this place.  We stopped by the location outside of Cesars Place and had the option of waiting 20 minutes to dine-in or order outside at the window. We chose to order outside and it took quite a while. I ordered the frozen hot chocolate, which was $10 and was sorely disappointed. It was basically a glorified frosty with whipped cream, served in a plain cup with sprinkles. The prices differ between inside and outside which is why I think it looked different - but I just don't think that this chocolate milkshake was worth it at all. I also ordered a corndog because I was starving. I realize that corndogs aren't their specialty but it was totally microwaved and for $6 I expected a little bit more :(
1107	0	This place was a joke, we went there after making a reservation that they would not honor.  After 2 hours in the line, they approved us to get inside.  So was it worth the wait, no way. The place was packed so much that we couldn't even move once we got in.  Got pushed around, one drunk guy even picked a fight with me since we got pushed over him.  The bounders sided the other guy coz it looked like he had paid more money to get a table (can run upwards of 5k on weekends).   All in all, an experience I just want to forget.  There are much better clubs in Vegas, avoid this at all costs.. or rather unless you cough up 5 grand.
1108	0	fine, the ice cream is pretty great. i'd recommend getting one sundae to share with three people. there's a reason they are around fifteen dollars and it's because they are seriously huge. they are all delicious. oh and i tried a really great strawberry milkshake too! though those are regular size and also ten dollars.  the wait is always long, though the takeout window seemed to be moving much faster than our wait time for  table. it also took a really long time to get our food, even though all we got was sundaes and a milkshake. didn't mind since the place is nice to hang out.  two stars because our waiter hated us. maybe because we just ordering desserts and he's used to bigger orders, but even with that we were spending at least forty dollars. that was kind of annoying since we weren't even spending extra time there, just waiting for our food. i have to say that soured the experience a little. if i'm ever back here again, i'd probably do the takeout window. but the ice cream really is good.
1109	0	So yeah, after a girl's night out on the strip, I woke up and was starving at 10a.m. on a Sunday. A friend and I ventured out together to look for some food to nourish my belly. We found this spot randomly while walking around the Cosmo, and got enticed into eating here thinking that starchy foods (rice and noodles) with some greasy (mexican) would be the best fit for my physical, mental, and emotional state.    I got the crazy nachos topped with a fried egg, because who doesn't like some greasy food to coat the stomach after a hard night of drinking. It was their attempt at a "fancy" gourmet chillaquillas. It was mehhhhhhhhhhh. Even my desperate hung over state couldn't appreciate this.   I shared some shiu-mai for 13 bucks, and that was a disappointment. We also split some tacos (barbacoa and cochinta). Barcacoa was whatever, but that cochinta was quite unforgettable. It had some crispy pork that gave it a nice crunch. The toppings were amazeballs. I'd skip everything and come back for this one taco.   I think I drank about 7 glasses of water, because it tasted sooooo dang good. I totally thought it was some special water, only to find out from the waitress who said, "Oh, it's just tap water." Yeah, that was embarrassing. The food was overpriced, but those 7 glasses of water kinda sorta made up for our meh brekkie meal and hefty $50 bill.  Next time I come back, I'll be ordering two Cochinta tacos and drinking 10 glasses of TAP water.
1110	1	I've been to GR restaurants in US & UK and there's a reason he's one of the best and produces that way. The menu is awesome. I finally got the beef Wellington and it was divine. The sticky toffee pudding - one of the best desserts in your life. There's a reason its award winning. The service was fantastic. Also had the bone marrow and we asked for bread and it came with real English muffins that were very rich but yummy. The lobster tail was ok. Definitely a fantastic meal. Just don't gamble in that casino. Dealers are beyond rude.
1111	0	My friend and I came here on December 21st for dinner after it was recommended to us by the Tix4tonight because it was close to our show's location.  We thought... meh why not?   The ambiance of the place was pretty good and the waitstaff there were very hospitable - the only aspects that prevents it from getting one star. Other than that, I would definitely not go back.  The food, first of all, was HORRIBLE.  For the price of almost $30, I've never been to a buffet more terrible than this one.  Basically, it's an International Buffet with foods: Chinese, Japanese, Latin, Italian, BBQ/roasted meats, seafoods... and of course all-you-can-drink beer, wine and non-alcoholic stuff.  The crab legs were tasteless, sushi rolls were unimpressive (rice was too hard), their Chinese food consisted mostly of North Americanized creations.  At the Italian stations, their food was lukewarm.   I've walked around the buffet many many circles to find things I'd like to eat but unfortunately didn't have too many things on my plate.  Besides the dessert station which was okay, their food selection, variety and quality was inadequate.  When tasting the food, it just doesn't taste fresh and we were both really really disappointed.
1112	1	Just a dinner here. Service is great - bunch of people run by our table. Food was good. Portions are not as big as in the Thai St Cafe. $11 a meal. Would've put 4 stars but it fascinates me how this place grew from a whole in the wall to such a big place. Is it all because of celebrities?
1113	1	I highly recommend this place. The food was really good and the service excellent. We ordered the Gangnam meal for 2, but it fed 4 people nicely (although you probably want to try some other things too). It gives you a sample of many different meats. Plus, if you write a review, you get a free desert! The price is a little on the higher end, but definitely worth it.
1114	1	What and Amazing Experience! The food was flavorful, freshly prepared, and spot on! What an amazing wine list - my friend is a Sommelier - was mesmerized by the variety and affordable price point. The only thing that I have to say negative is that the service is not nearly as OUTSTANDING as the food!
1115	1	Best Thai food I've had, and I live in L.A.  Unlikely city, unlikely location, a nondescript strip mall on a run-down stretch of Sahara Ave., but oh the food!  I've been here several times now (try to make a couple of visits every time I'm in Vegas, sometimes twice in a day, it's so good).  Great beef salad, excellent curries, grilled chicken, wonderful homemade ice cream.  We've tried a lot of different dishes and everything we've had was great.  Ask for recommendations from the waiter also: that 's how we tried the catfish and the Nam Kao Tod, crispy rice with pork sausage.  They also have a great selection of Northern Thai dishes that you rarely find in other places.    Once, we tried to order the mango with sticky rice but they warned us beforehand that the mangos weren't fully ripe and gave us a sampling of the mango to test whether we really wanted it.  It tasted OK, perhaps a little less sweet than a ripe mango in-season.  We decided to go with some of their home-made coconut ice cream instead.  I think this anecdote really shows the detail and care they put into their food.    They have a lunch buffet on the weekends (geared more toward the locals or the typical tourist) which I wouldn't recommend, but you can still special order dishes during that time.  They apparently have a world-class wine list as well, but I haven't tried it; with the heat of Thai food, I always find myself craving a beer.    Despite all the fancy, big-name restaurants in the city, the meals I have here are always the most memorable.
1116	0	This restaurant looked really cool from the outside.  I guess I got sucked in by all the beautiful fishes in the fish tanks.  I also thought how bad can noodles be from BeiJin?  Whua, shocker!  It was BAD!  They said they the noodles were hand-pulled.  I know how hand-pulled noodles should taste.  These were not even close.  The texture were too soft and didn't have the Q (Al Dante) they should have.  The Pork and mushroom sauce were so little, I had to add soy sauce to the noodles in order to eat it.    The order of  'Beef Pancakes' has 2 and were the size of dollar coin.    Conclusion - very small portion, very expensive, and very bad food!  Don't be enticed by the fish tanks like I did.  WALK FAR FAR AWAY from this place!  It's not even worthy of 1 star!
1117	1	Wow!! Best burger I have had in such a long time! I got the Gordon Ramsay burger and onion rings. The burger had duck bacon which was a little like turkey bacon but better. The flavors here just blend so well together. The service is fast and the waiters were so polite and helpful about the menu questions we had.  I love this place! I always try to stop by here when I am in town!
1118	1	The king of all pizza joints on the West Coast.  Period.  They make an excellent piping hot thin crust pie.  It will make you forget how much money the Cosmo casino just took you for.  This is the mecca of late night eating in Vegas.  Play a round of pool, people watch on the swanky lounge chairs out front, and then devour your pie along with all of the other dolled up women and rico suaves from the clubs.
1119	1	This was the second time that my wife and i had eaten there. The word AMAZING sums it up. We arrived right when the doors opened for dinner and where seated right away. The food was amazing and not horribly priced, especially when you look at the fact that you basically get 2 meals out of one meal. Really good food and great wait staff. One of our favorites and it is worth the trek off the strip if you are a visitor
1120	0	Maybe this place and I got off on the wrong foot, the rooms are ok the ac cranks pretty well, they have nice flatscreens and the shower puts out hot water.    Unfortunately it is a bargain hotel so you do get some "interesting" folks in the elevator en route to your room.    If you book the resort things get a little nicer, they have an exclusive (using the term lightly) lounge, give you free wi fi and even have complimentary wine and beer during the evening hours.    Thats where the upside ends,  The pool is incredibly small and shaped weird, the drinks are watered down and the dining is laughable.  I tried to get a bite to eat and ended up having to go to 3 places before I could find a decent meal to go.  First I went to Tres Rios, The Vince Niel Place, and learned that the actual kitchen has been closed for 18 months and they only do happy hour drinks and appetizers, Literally thats all they open for, then I try to go to the Benihana garden and hit up the sushi bar they have in there to grab a few rolls for my wife and I and learn they are CLOSED FOR THE SUMMER, finally I have to go the cafe and order a boring grilled chicken sandwich.  I would have gone to another casino but I had my kid and my wife waiting for me upstairs.  Who closes a Mexican food joint with a celebrity owner and a Sushi place in Vegas??    The only reason this place gets 2 stars is because the rooms are alright and they give free soft drinks, beer and wine for the resort club members.  If you stay here thats fine but dont expect to spend any other time/money here other than sleeping and re hydrating after the partying you did the night before.    If I can avoid coming here again I will.
1121	0	WAY too expensive for what you get! Got the steak and eggs for $20 literally finished it in 5 bites! The steak was TINY, OVERCOOKED, & FLAVORLESS. Gotta say I was a fan of the lychee mimosa but it was way more juice than champagne. I would save the money n go somewhere else like Earl of Sandwiches!
1122	1	The best brunch on the strip!!!  Since they don't take reservations for brunch but recommend coming in earlier to avoid longer wait, I along with my friends got there around 9:30 and were seated within a few mins.  From the first moment you step on you can feel the cheerful/bright ambiance. Service, decor, and creativity all are bound to win your heart.  The food is definitely authentic french and hence even the French toast aren't the traditional ones you get at the American brunch restaurants. Not to say it was anything short of delicious.  Overall I had a great time and can't wait to get back for round 2 the next time I'm in that city.
1123	0	Okay, first of all. If you are going to charge that much money, you better try a little bit harder to make the food taste good. Almost $20 per person!!! They take advantage of the fact that they are on the strip and just charge extra for it. Maybe if they made better food it wouldn't be much a big deal for $20. The food was so bad that we were still hungry after we left because we couldn't finish it. Save yourselves the trouble (and money) and go somewhere else.
1124	1	Went there for my wife's birthday celebration and enjoyed their wonderful brunch menu. Everything from start to finish was spot on. Our waiter Doug went out of his way to ensure our experience was amazing. His service and personable touches added to our enjoyment.  Nice atmosphere,  Excellent food, and Impeccable service. What more can I say? Thank you for a memorable time!
1125	1	I've had a lot of Korean BBQ and this place is my favorite. I like how you can cook the meat on your own. This means that no meat gets cold and hard cause you're chowing on something else. Also the smaller portions mean you can try different meats without committing to one type. Servers came by and checked on us often, great service.
1126	1	This restaurant is incredible! The service and food quality is always top notch. Future father in-law loved his Beef Wellington, and my fiance with a small appetite ate every bit of his delicious rib cap! My lobster and truffled fingerling potatoes were amazing! I could eat 50 of both! The best drink-The Drifter-amazing! Our server was Ted, followed by our server assistant Sean. They were both extremely knowledgable about the menu/food allergies/beef origins and selection. With impeccable service and stellar food, my family and I cannot wait to go back!
1127	1	We always stop here for at LEAST one (Bamboozled) adult milkshake while we are in Vegas!  Very unique choices and VERY filling. We usually don't eat before having one of these!  I think it's cool that they fill your glass to the rim AND give you the shaker with the "left over" shake!  So delicious! We had an appetizer once (maybe fried pickles?) but we literally only stop here for these amazing treats!! There's just no room for food when it comes to these shakes!! Yummy!!!!
1128	1	I stopped in after all the positive reviews, I must say it was right on par. The food was good, banana nut muffin was great, and the staff was awesome! It's actually the great staff that took the 4 star food rating to a 5 star overall diner rating. Thanks guys!
1129	1	Coming from Ohio, we had no idea where to go for brunch until my brother suggested The Egg & I. The food was awesome! Oscar, our waiter gave us the best service possible! The other staff members were so nice as well. We waited, but not long considering it was Sunday morning! The banana nut muffin is delicious and the portions we received were huge! Great place to go if you're looking for a breakfast/lunch idea!
1130	0	One word - horrible!!!!    But I should start on a positive. The salad was neat. They make it for you. But have weird asst of fixings and way too much salad dressing. They did have a grilled cauliflower that was yummy. And the pizza was great but not worth $30. Nathan said the prime rib and ribs were yummy and went back for seconds. Of course his last meal was chicken nuggets at noon at the airport.   Honestly there was no food here that I liked. The soups are weird colors and look canned and sitting way too long. The sushi was horrible. Dried out. Don't make so much if folks aren't eating it. The pot stickers were greasy. The vegetable spring roll was mostly roll with a few slivers of cabbage and on of carrot.  The potato augratin which is usually hard to pass up couldn't be cut up with a fork.  Overall YUCK!!!  Save your money.
1131	1	This place rocks. Break out of your Pad Thai rut and order Northern specialties like the Kao Tod appetizer - spicy sour sausage salad, and the whole catfish, charcoal grilled. Ask for the two sauces, chili-lime and tamarind. Order a glass of Riesling from their extensive collection. You'll be glad you did.
1132	1	My last meal on earth. I always try to stop here while in Vegas. Absolutely to die for.   My favorite -- Specifically the Roasted Chicken and Bacon & Chive Waffle. OUT OF THIS WORLD. The chicken is served a breast and a thigh with black truffle gravy. The waffle is served with Vanilla Bean butter and warm maple syrup. It doesn't look like much food but its just enough to fill you up and the presentation is beautiful.  Service is quick and attentive.
1133	1	after spending a night and half the morning at the palms burning tons of calories on the dance floor i figured that i needed to refuel.  earlier in the day i had been told by some people at the wynn that the best late night/early morning eats could be had here.    i am not gonna lie. at first i was a bit skeptical. after spending a few too many hours gambling at the $5 blackjack tables at circus circus the night before i happened across this place on my way back the wynn.  maybe it was the bitterness from the money i lost. maybe it was the on-setting alcohol poisoning. whatever it was, i was less than impressed.  ladies and gentlemen of yelp. i implore you. do not judge a book by its cover. because this place is a gem. i ordered nachos. (my new go to for late night eats). a platter of nachos the size of a sewer lid was placed in front of me. and they were delicious. in fact they gave me exactly what i needed: greasy, fatty, awesomeness.  i could not even finish half. i am not even joking. and the nachos were not the only large portioned meal. there were more leftovers on the table than food in our collective stomachs.   so a few tips for your next vegas visit:  1.) drink and dance until about 6 am  2.) go to the peppermill 3.) order the nachos 4.) enjoy the deliciousness  youre welcome.
1134	1	Finally, after years of living in Vegas, I finally had the best Thai spot in town (some say best in country), and it totally lived up to the hype.   Saturday Night - take note of the hours before heading there. They open at 5:30pm and close at 10pm. But don't assume they won't get business for the few hours. Arrived at 5:20pm and there stood a 60+ person line outside while the parking lot was filling fast - and don't worry, there's a LOT of seating so you'll be seated quickly after opening.   Inside looks like a big dining hall. One area has normal tables for small families while the other area  can probably accommodate for your party of 100. Also interesting and didn't find this out til later, they take reservations!  The staff works so well like an oiled machine. It's impressive how good they are in their knowledge of the menu and they're so polite too - especially when they're dealing with such large and loud groups.   The food was delicious. As like many others, this cuisine was new to me and I didn't know what to order. But reading through probably 100s of items on the thick menu, I went with the infamous Garlic Prawns ($27.95), Panang Curry with beef ($11.95), and Khao Soi ($10.95) and it was all so good. Flavors from lime, coconut, egg and curry mixes are such a unique taste that I have to come back here for more.
1135	0	Do NOT go here. The bartender told me the burgers are done just right with a little pink on the inside. Mine showed up charred on the outside and 100% RAW inside. At first they tried to play it off like it was supposed to be a little pink and didn't want to admit their mistake.   If you're in the mood for incredibly expensive burgers, I would recommend going elsewhere.
1136	0	Overpriced and underwhelming. I'm so disappointed  I wasted a meal eating here.  A salad, shake, soda and burger with a side of onion rings for $50???? The salad was over dressed and extremely salty. The burger tasted like it was a frozen grocery store patty.  Not worth the trip at all.
1137	0	Tao is incredibly overstuffed with pompous people. The main dance floor is far too busy to enjoy yourself. You begin sifting through bodies of people and realize that it's not worth it the effort.  I've been to other nightclubs on the Strip and I was looking forward to this place considering the hype. I was left with a boring experience.  Big frills, few thrills.
1138	1	Ugh this place is so good. I'm somewhat glad this place is 4+ hours away since I would just get fat going here.  Service Super attentive ! Water was always filled and I didn't have to raise my hand for too long if I needed something. Bae and I came here without a reservation on a Saturday (they only serve dinner at 5:30pm on weekends) and sat in a line for maybe 8min at most.  Food - garlic prawns.  What is there to say ? Incredibly flavorful, buttery and garlicky and I don't even know what else I'm eating but I just know my tongue is super happy. Bae and I got maybe 8 prawns and we still had leftovers - boat noodle soup (combination beef noodle soup/#109) Holy this is prolly my fav thing here other than the prawns. So incredibly flavorful and it almost makes me cry from whatever flavors my tongue is experiencing. Kicks my hometown Thai place's boat noodle soup out of the water. Honestly this doesn't even need the vermicelli noodles. If you get this with the beef and the bean sprouts, in combination with the amazing broth, you won't even miss the noodles. Get this. - khao soi Egg noodles in a light curry sauce with beef topped with crispy egg noodles. This was a tad hair shorter in the flavor department compared to the boat noodle soup, but with a squeeze of lime, it elevated the flavor tenfold. Pretty good, kind of a small portion. - nam kao tod (crispy fried rice) If you're looking for a flavor explosion with a bit of a crunch, I'd recommend this. Filled with crispy rice (how do they do it...), peanuts, a healthy dose of lime, sour pork sausage, red onions, I'm sure fish sauce, peanuts and other stuff, this is a party in your mouth. Compared to Vientiane (garden grove), this place stands it's ground for crispy rice. Bae kept looking up and pondering how this made his tastebuds flip. - mango sticky rice I love sticky rice and bae has never had mango sticky rice, so this was perfect. The rice seemed a little hard (chewier) than other ones I had, but it also had a fragrant jasmine taste to it. The mangoes were the small ones and it was an ample amount. Sweet and yummy, bae ate the whole thing.
1139	1	You definitely have to try their version of a banana nut muffin. I've never eaten a banana nut muffin quite like it.  Now I know why they're famous for it.  I also love their newspaper-like menus, very creative.    It is a comfortable atmosphere and friendly service.  This is a popular restaurant, and we went on a Saturday morning, thus we had to wait for about 15 minutes for a table, which isn't bad at all. It took a while for us to decide on what to order because everything (they had quite a variety of choices on the menu) sounded so appetizing.  After we finally ordered, our food came out quickly, and everyone was pleased w/ each of our orders.  Everything looked very good and tasted great too.      It's not located that far away from the Vegas Strip, and it's definitely worth the short drive.  It's also a nice getaway from the chaos and traffic where the casinos are.  I certainly couldn't have gotten a decent and fairly priced breakbreast/brunch meal somewhere on the Strip. From now on, whenever I visit Vegas, I'll have to goeat at Egg and I.
1140	1	We had a 5 star experience with 13 guests in a private area.  Service was excellent and timely.  We first received bread basket.  Then a great warm spinach & artichoke dip with pita chips.  My ginger beef was delish.  My neighbor's beef wellington was beautiful.  Another's chicken parm was excellent.  Their dessert carrot cake is excellent-well balanced.  Their prices are reasonable for such a class act.  They did take a long time between dinner and dessert-we were in there well over two hours but it was a perfect dining experience for our celebrating group.
1141	1	Hubby and I are here in Vegas and coincidently Bachi Burger was featured on DDD, so we had to check it out and OMG....it is worth the drive off the strip. We had the oxtail chili fries as an appetizer. I liked them, but hubby was not impressed. He thought they were a little sweet, but they are dressed with garlic alioli that is quite tasty. I had the Bachni Burger, which was the BEST BURGER I HAVE EVER HAD!!!  The meat was extremely flavorful and the condiments that accompanied the burger were wisely chosen and accommodated the flavor of the burger perfectly. We also had the pork sticky buns which were tasty as well. All in all, I would HIGHLY recommend.
1142	0	Good thing we had Groupons for the food and drinks.  They were terribly overpriced.  Besides the pricing, our server was terrible.  She took our food order and then we never saw her again.  We waited 15 minutes after eating to pay.  We had to track down another server to bring us the bill.  She said she would have our server help us.  After waiting 10 minutes, we paid at the bar and left.  Terrible customer service for the outrageously priced items.
1143	1	Great BBQ. Service is fast and with a smile.  You get 3 unique sauces for your BBQ.  Set plates are plenty for the number of people you order for.  The place doesn't smoke up so there is good ventilation and a nice environment with plenty of space between tables.  Seats could be comfier though.
1144	1	Shake Shack delivers!  Ok.....not like to your home, but they surely do provide FLAVOR and SATISFACTION!  I have been dying to try Shake Shack since my fiance visited Las Vegas without me a few months ago, and was so glad to finally squeeze in some time to stop here on our recent visit.  I ordered the Shack Stack, which is a combination of their vegan burger (stuffed portobello mushroom) on top of their signature patty.  Don't judge me....it was my first experience so I wanted to GO BIG!  My boo insisted on ordering their cheese fries and you know I don't argue when it comes to cheese. *heart eye emoji*  For a busy night on the strip, we didn't wait TOO long.  Our burgers were ready in about 5-10 minutes.  I mean, they have a whole army behind the counter cooking!  The portobello mushroom was fried nicely and had a great crispy outer layer, while still remaining moist inside.  The cheese filled center was absolutely delicious!  Crinkle cut fries are my favorite.  Cover it with a creamy cheese sauce and I am a happy girl!  Finally, their house made shandy was the perfect touch for enjoying our burgers in the hot Las Vegas heat!    The prices are kind of high, but for a restaurant on the strip it's reasonable.  Don't plan to share - portion sizes are just enough.
1145	0	The food is subpar here. The Rio is way better. I came here because it's part of the Buffet of Buffets.  Go for the Cotton candy and pre-sliced crab legs. The chinese and indian stations looked very sad. I made myself fancy salads with chilled shrimp and snow crab legs.  The crepe station makes sweets only. It's really greasy compared to the Paris buffet.  It's a pretty small buffet.
1146	0	We stayed here over the Labor day weekend as standard rooms in the hotel were available at a reasonable rate even at the last minute, reasons for which would become clear when we actually reached the place - its pretty beat up, dilapidated and run down.  Checking in took under 10 minutes even though there were tons of people waiting before us so not much to complain here.  The hotel is a good 12-15 minute leisurely walk to the strip from the hotel with no restaurants immediately outside the hotel apart from an ampm store attached to an arco gas station. We ended up eating most of our meals at the food court of the Riviera which is located on Las Vegas Blvd - this turned out to be a pain with about 20 minutes of walking as we could not take our car due to lack of parking on the strip.  The self service car park is not directly attached to the hotel but is a good 3-5 minutes walk from the hotel itself which was a pain.   The hotel itself is very run down. Right of the bat the lever for the shower in the room was locked so tight that we were not able to get it to budge and had to call someone from maintenance to get it to move. Then it would not turn off and water kept dripping into the tub making a noise the entire day. When we complained, maintenance came and just tightened the lever back to the tight position rather than fixing the problem which meant another call to maintenance when we wanted to use the shower. Water in the sink would not drain normally and took almost 45 minutes to seep out slowly which gave a gross feeling. The air conditioning unit did not have a proper thermostat for control but only allowed for setting the fan speed from low to high which had no effect on the cooling it was hot during the day and chilled during night. On the second day all of a sudden the room refused to let me in with my key and then it was a treck down to the reception to get another key and guess what that also refused to work so it was back down to the reception where they simply apologized and gave me another key, but by now I knew what to expect and refused to budge till they called security to escort me to the room as it was my third trip. The people at the reception did not think that was required but I stood my ground - finally I'm sure you would have guessed by now that the key did not work even the third time and security had to override the lock to let me in and call the locksmith to have that fixed. So overall was not a very comfortable stay.   Cleaning is done between 9-10 a.m. and if you skip that you can get a $8 coupon to be used in the casino or for some food but you need to call and let them know the night before.   They provide water bottles and coffee in the room ($4 each) which I liked specially the coffee as there is no place to grab that near the hotel early in the morning.  Overall this would not be my first choice when selecting a hotel near the strip and I would prefer the Stratosphere, but it was not terrible considering that we got it at the last minute during peak time at a reasonable rate.
1147	0	Tonight my family and I dined at the MGM Grand Buffet, complimentary buffet thanks to New York New York. I must say this buffet was far from Grand ... It wasn't that great at all. I am glad i didn't spend $86 of my own money. This buffet needs more kid friendly food. My daughter had fried chicken, slice of pizza, vegetables, salad.   As I walked around the buffet, I noticed they had minimal selections of food. The woman working the carving station in charge of the prime beef, turkey, and sausage seemed brand new! I watched her cut slices of prime rib, they would splash onto the cutting board & the juice from the meat splattered over 2 customers onto their clothes. The prime rib was under cooked, the turkey slices were cut too thick, & were dry.   I ventured over to where the crab legs & shrimp were located. The crab legs looked decent, but I didn't have any. The shrimp .... Oh my goodness ... I can't believe this hotel served this fishy, smelly, old shrimp to their patrons. The shrimp was brown, smelled really horrible, & had white dots on it ... (Please see the picture of the old shrimp I uploaded) ! I know what OLD shrimp looks like & they had a whole big tray full of it ... People were grabbing them by the spoonfuls ... Ick I was getting ill !   The desserts were decent. They have a delicious Oreo cheesecake, chocolate cupcake, and carrot cake. The servers wait staff was pleasant, but didn't attend to us very much.   Would we come back here for bland food & old shrimp ..... NO thank you.
1148	0	View is good, beer selection is poor.  Service was good.  I had the baby back ribs, honestly were the worst I have ever had, and I have eaten and cooked a lot of ribs.  They were way overcooked to the point the meat tasted like bone marrow, then they were drowned in bbq sauce.  Not impressed with the food quality at all, will not be coming back when in town, at least not for the food!
1149	1	We were here on Tuesday evening and were seated within 5 minutes for a party of 5.  We had the Korean Prime Kalbi, Prime Kalbi, Flat Iron Garlic, Beef Toro, Bulgogi, Salmon with Bacon, Enoki with Bacon, and Japche.  Everything was delicious and the meat was very tender.  My kids are picky and they ate almost everything, which was amazing.  Service was very attentive to us.  We will be back the next time we are in Vegas!
1150	0	We waited almost an hour to be seated when there were only 3 groups in front of us in line. We got the shrimp wonton soup and some chowmein. I thought the food was boring. I dropped a shrimp wonton in my lap and our server, who was taking an order at the table next to us, stopped what he was doing to point and laugh at me, then finished talking to the table and didnt even stop by to offer me a napkin. When I stopped him later to ask for one he acted put out. They charged us for our tea, and it was gross. I thought the food was boring, and wayyyy overpriced. They dont even put vegetables in their chowmein.  I would have only given them one star because I hated the whole experience, but I had to add a star because my husband was happy with getting a chance to sit down and eat what he called simple food. It made him happy so they earn a star.
1151	1	the best thai food in las vegas!   you would never guess that the best thai food in vegas is in some nondescript crappy strip mall a few miles off the strip but it is.  be prepared to wait...I dont know that they do reservations but its worth it.  the food is excellent and is quite reasonable especially when you compare it to comparable quality restaurants in the major casinos!
1152	0	I've heard a lot of good things about this but I wasn't impressed. I went during lunch to the outdoor portion. I think the food was overpriced. I think I paid 11 bucks for just an average salad. They have outdoor seating but there was bird poop on all the seats and the birds fly everywhere while you eat. I'd still like to try the frozen hot chocolate, but other than that I don't plan on going back.
1153	1	It was a Saturday night and a group of 9 of us decided to get together and catch up. Haven't been to Bachi in a long time so we decided on dinner around 7. It was definitely busy for a weekend, but that was to be expected.  The host took down our name and quoted an estimated time of seating to be around 15-20 minutes. We waited patiently, the host did a great job controlling the flow of the restaurant and seated us right around the quoted wait time.    We sat down and Jade greeted us with a smile. She was friendly, prompt, and professional. Some of us had not been there before, so she went through the menu and addressed all the questions that some of us had. She suggested some cocktails and drinks along with her favorites on the menu. We proceeded with some shared appetizers and that arrived, we ordered our entrees. We loved the fact that everyone was served at the same time with entrees and our drinks were constantly filled. Jade checked up on us frequently and was very engaging, yet she let us have our space when needed. Since there was 9 of us, a good variation of the menu was ordered. The ramen I had was perfect! Not too salty, not to spicy, it was perfect! Everyone who ordered burgers was touting how well it was prepared and the cocktails were a hit. We loved that the manager Erika not only came by to say hello and check up on us, but she is every engaging with the entire restaurant.  She even ran some of our food to our table.  At the end of our night, dessert was ordered. Can't remember what we had but it was wonderful, definitely satisfied our sweet tooth! Jade asked if we wanted split checks for such a large party, we declined but was pleasantly surprised that the check was already split based on seating position. Not only was it split in each seating position, it was done correctly. We were impressed not just but the deliciousness of the food, the hustle and bustle of the restaurant, but also the staff. They were all friendly and definitely was a hit with everyone. We will for sure see you all soon! Bravo!
1154	1	This places is fantastic!!  Erin was our server for b'fast last Saturday and she was great!  Good prices, great food and very friendly.  We went twice over a 2 week tour of NV and CA. Would highly recommend going here to get away from the hustle and bustle of the Strip!
1155	0	This casino buffet could do way better for the price they charge their customers. The quality of the food is mediocre. Crab legs were avaliable but only chilled ones. No hot steamy ones. Overall the food just reminds me of eating at a malls for court.
1156	1	Yummmm! Food portion is great! I usually eat all of my food, but needed a to go box. I got the chicken mushroom and spinach skillet and it was delish! Hubby got the sunrise and he loved it so much, he wouldnt give me a bit. And he had leftovers. Oscar waa great and attentive. Will definitely come back when we're in town again.
1157	0	Some girlfriends and I spent the weekend of 4/20 in Vegas...which was kinda amazing. But do you know what lacked amazingness? This place!  My friend REALLY wanted to go here because she has some kind of "foodie crush" on the dude that opened the place. Or the head chef. Or someone important like that. We all assumed it was going to be a Mexican/Chinese fusion- but the two sides of the menu (and the dishes) are completely separate.  While the atmosphere, and the idea, are both super fun, the place lacks execution. I was not a fan of my soup, and while my lemon shrimp were bomb in flavor, they didn't sit well later!  With so many culinary gems in the city of sin, I suggest you indulge elsewhere!
1158	1	So much has been said already, so I will be brief.  This is a great restaurant in a casino, yet so far from the casino, you really feel like you're getting away. By every measure, I had a better meal here than I had at Bouchon in Yountville, much to my surprise. Two of us shared what seemed like ten different things, and just about everything worked.  I can't imagine ever returning without having something from the raw bar.  The service was impeccably good.
1159	1	Another night in Vegas, another wonderful steakhouse.  Gordon Ramsay steak is one of the newer upscale steakhouses in Vegas and is located conveniently in the center of the strip at the Paris hotel.  I have eaten at some of the other Gordon Ramsay eateries in Vegas and neither of them compare to this one.  In fact, very few steakhouses on the strip compare to this.  The decor, the service, and the food are all fantastic.  We first started with some drinks, bread (some of the best free bread around) and the seafood platter for 4.  This was one of the best tasting seafood platters I have had.  Everything was fresh and came with a variety of sauces which were amazing.  The crab and lobster was especially tasty.   After the starter, I ordered the salmon and the table also shared a porterhouse.  The salmon was very good, and actually a very good portion size.  Normally they make the salmon with a cauliflower puree that when you squeeze lemon over it, it turns purple, but I think they did a seasonal vegetable with it this time (which stayed one color).  The porterhouse was as good as it gets.  Nothing to fancy on the cook, just a very flavorful and moist steak.  Make sure to get a few extra bites off the bone, that's where you get some of the best meat bites.    The spinach at GR is also one of the best sides I've ever had.  Just a great blend of garlic and oil to make the spinach super tasty and not too drenched.    For desert I tried the peanut butter bar.  Very good, but nothing amazing.  Overall, one of my favorite meals in Vegas.
1160	1	came here for dinner on Feb 22. when i showed up they were very freindly. told me there was a 10 min delay. so they took us to the bar. we ordered drinks and right before we got them they told us our table was ready. i knew what i wanted before i even walked in there.  that was the beef wellington. but i wasnt just about to order i was going to enjoy the whole experince. the waiter introduced himself and his assistant. gave us the bread and water. $9 a bottle. so it isnt free guys. they showed us all the cuts of beef. they all looked awesome. we ordered and waited a fairly good amount for the food. thankully we ordered the shrimp. that was some good shrimp. delicious. then our orders came in. i received the beef wellington and the wife got the chicken. that thing melted in my mouth. the chicken was great too. the wellington was medium rare. cant wait for another visit.
1161	1	Loved this place... its off strip but worth the drive out here.  The crispy duck was awesome with tons of flavors and an awesome sauce.  The garlic shrimp was unique as you can eat the entire shrimp (shell and all) since they fry the shell and it melts in your mouth when you eat it!  The only cons I would say was the service was spotty at times as it took 10-15mins to even get waiter to order.  But once we did get the waiter, we had pretty good service afterwards.  The portions are smaller than average but then again what they make up for portions, they gain in flavor and quality.  I would suggest ordering 2 dishes & appetizer or 3 dishes for a party of two.  It is a little more pricier than the average thai place but well worth it!
1162	0	We came here for the Nachos, which many people seem to order and my friends had seen it and couldn't stop thinking about them. Well I have to say, what a disappointment!! We ordered the 4 cheese Nacho platter (we have a vegetarian in the group) and asked them to add black beans, which they charge extra for! The nachos come out with very little pico de gallo, and literally a sprinkle of black beans. The good thing was the waiter came out with a bowl of more black beans b/c he realized how very little we were given (so yes A for service).   The nachos were just not good. One of the 4 cheeses tasted like Velveeta. I think for this price the nachos need more substance such as jalapenos, onions, pico de gallo, salsa, beans...   Oh and another think this place has pretty bad smell in certain parts of the restaurant (poor sewage perhaps?)
1163	0	I was honestly so dissapointed when I ate there. I honestly do not know what everyone was fussing about how it's the greatest thing in the world.  Cons: The line was long, (as suspected since it's new) once you get inside, there's another line. I don't know if they still have long lines since people know it's not the best lol The burgers were tiny and had very little taste to them, which I assume it's how it is in where it came from. It was very expensive for what you got to be honest. It was not good at all, way way over price. Like In-n-Out is better lol The kitchen where you can see them cooking the burgers is very unsanitary looking. There were buns everywhere, chopped onions on the floor, not to mention their was pretty brown lol DO NOT WORRY IF YOU HAVEN'T GONE THERE, YOU'RE NOT MISSING ANYTHING.  Pros:...umm they have really good chicken rings?  Hope this helps. I honestly would recommend to go there just to taste it just so you can say you've had it but I honestly doubt that anyone is going to return. Unless you're a tourist and drunk at 4 in the morning.
1164	1	My boyfriend and I enjoyed a lovely date night at this restaurant.  All of the staff members were polite and courteous, and were clearly working together as a team. It's nice to see a restaurant function like a piece of well-oiled machinery.  Our server Matthew was absolutely WONDERFUL. If you are headed there, request him - I know I will the next time I'm there.  We enjoyed a half bottle of Duckhorn Merlot that was lovely. Our appetizer was the Kurobuta Pork Belly with grits - tasty and not overly filling. My boyfriend being the GR fan that he is ordered the Beef Wellington which was, of course, divine. I ordered the Lamb entree, which (unfortunately) was incorrectly prepared medium-well the first time around. BUT - Matthew was on it and visited our table right after I had sliced into the chop, and whisked the plate away with the sincerest of apologies and a promise to bring fresh sides. We had the Mac & Cheese and Sauteed Spinach sides - AWESOME, I swear the spinach was a whole bag's worth and absolutely delicious. It took a little while to bring my re-fired lamb back, but when it came (with fresh sides) it was wonderful. We also enjoyed a tasting menu of deserts: apple tart, Toffee Pudding (YOU MUST ORDER THIS), and [chocolate thing that was so delicious but I don't know what it was]. Enjoyed some delicious French-pressed coffee as well.  OVERALL a fantastic experience with all the frills of fine-dining but without the snooty, uppity atmosphere that I've encountered. The restaurant is super modern and very visionary - don't expect to have a quiet meal because the restaurant is somewhat noisy.  BUT you will experience great service and excellent food.  Thanks Matthew for a memorable and WONDERFUL evening!
1165	0	Food tasted ok. Nothing special. The menu had maybe 10 items on it. Service was ok. Highlight was the lady making the balloon hats. She was amazing. Kids meals were almost $9 and nothing exciting. Atmosphere was dead. The Senor Frogs we've previously been to were amazing. This one sucked. Wouldn't recommend or go back.
1166	1	There are lots of great reviews on here so I will just confirm that it's amazing and that you must go. Get the croque madame!  The tips I have are that it's a bit hard to find, go to the check in area and take the elevator tucked in the corner to the right. Also, the doors to the pool area don't require a key card so it's a great space to lounge while waiting for your table. We went on a Sunday morning around 11am and only had to wait about 20 minutes, perfect experience.
1167	1	So I show up to grab a burger from BURGR, of course the line was about an hour wait, but when the hostess saw me she said I can go straight to the bar so good eye for that. The bar was packed but no worries. I ordered a Black Magic and sat down Lala has the perfect pour and with 30 beers on tap you can't go wrong.  I ordered the Hell's Kitchen burger and parm truffle fries both were on point, I am certain this will become a favorite spot for me.
1168	0	OMG, I thought Harrah Southern California had A bad buffet, this place was nasty. The bun was literally as hard as a rock I could not bite into it for real. Waited 10min at salad section as they have to make your salad and gave up waiting. The desserts look like they sat all day the lemon meringue pie has started to flatten on the plate. NEVER AGAIN all 4 of us agreed
1169	1	Whenever we come to Vegas, we make sure to stop here for breakfast. Everything tastes phenomenal and the amazing breakfast potatoes top it all off. All of the staff has been great! Reina even went out of her way to change an order at the last second. Definitely go here. You won't be disappointed.
1170	1	So glad I don't have to fly to New York just for shake shack. Although I love my In-N-Out, I have to admit that Shake Shake wins the West Coast vs East Coast rivalry. Shake Shack is now my favorite fast food restaurant. The Shack Stack is a complete mouthgasm. The double double from In-N-Out has the better sauce, but the giant fried portobello mushroom with cheese from the Shack Stack is unbeatable. The fries here are crinkled-cut, usually not my favorite, but they're actually well seasoned and crispy. I definitely prefer them over Animal style fries. I need to come back and try their milkshakes.
1171	0	I'm going to preface this review by saying that I stayed here for a few nights after receiving a special offer for a $22/night rate (plus an $18/night "resort fee" which gets you wifi--for one device--and not a whole heck of a lot else), so consider that the entire trip was done somewhat on the cheap when reading the following.  In terms of the condition of the hotel and the rooms, it's certainly not dirty or decrepit by any means, but it is aging and is overall rather bland--the owners' unwillingness to put any money into renovations is readily apparent. Look around and you'll see all kinds of remnants--there's an "M" festooning the storefront of the cubic zirconium shop, a relic from Barry Manilow's stint here. And the "Spacequest Casino" and surrounding areas, including the massive entrance to the now-defunct Star Trek Experience, have largely remained as-is, which means there is a huge inexplicably space-themed casino just off the lobby. Oh, and you can still see the enormous Star Trek insignia on the outside of the building when taking the Monorail elsewhere.  We encountered a number of niggling problems over the course of our stay. We checked in at approximately 11:30 PM on a Sunday night and were told at checkin that room service was 24 hours; indeed, even the screens in the lobby, as well as the menu in the guest directory, all seemed to confirm this. However, a phone call to room service revealed that it in fact ends at midnight. What's more, an attempt to order delivery (via the GrubHub website) resulted in a phone call from the GrubHub management telling us that they can't send delivery drivers to the LVH because (and this is a direct quote) "last time they called the cops on the driver." Apparently the hotel owners are so cheap and money-grubbing that they would rather you starve than order delivery--that, or resort to the late-night "deli" off the sports book which served little more than deep-fried crap from Sysco.  The nickel-and-diming doesn't stop there. Want to make a coffee in-room? That'll be $3.50, please. Those "complimentary" bottles of water? $4 each (though, in fairness, they only charged us $4 despite the fact that we drank about three of them each over the course of our stay). Want to use the landline with your calling card? That'll be $1. Oh, and want to use the sauna/steam room? That's $20 (per day), on top of your resort fee.  Housekeeping doesn't seem to give a crap about whether or not you're asleep. Starting at 7 AM on Monday, we heard extremely loud Spanish virtually non-stop through the wall for well over an hour as the housekeepers chatted away with each other while cleaning adjacent rooms. It wasn't exactly something you'd care to wake up to involuntarily.  As far as creature comforts go, the water pressure in the showers is ridiculously pathetic--indeed, Larry King's urine stream is likely more forceful than the dinky trickle that issued forth from the shower head. Additionally, the water valve in our bathroom wouldn't completely shut off, resulting in dripping that, while not particularly annoying, did seem wasteful. What's more, the "hot" water was really on the low side of warm; I was able to get truly hot water only on the last day of our stay.  Those are probably the main issues that we encountered. Again, I'm not going to completely pan the place--the beds are comfortable, the rooms are serviceable (especially if you can snag an upgrade), the in-room A/C is ice-cold, the elevators are fast, and the promo rates can't be beat, plus the direct connection to the monorail makes it a snap to get to the Strip. If budget is a concern, this place isn't a terrible choice if you don't mind taking a few lumps.
1172	1	Thank you GR for being my first......time trying Japanese Kobe.  A rare treat!    Food fabulous, service superb:    A perfect pairing were Charles N and Jered C.   Knowledgeable, professional, and welcoming, they walked us through an amazing meal.   We also enjoyed American Kobe.   There are not enough superlatives to describe the service and the entire meal.    Atmosphere is great.  We sat in a lovely round booth upstairs with a view of neon and restaurant.   One thing, tho, could you dim the interrogation light shining over us in the booth?    If in Vegas, it's a MUST!!  Best meal of my life!   We are huge GR fans.   Loved BurGR, as well.
1173	1	On the last trip to Vegas, my girlfriend and I made it to Bouchon for breakfast. As always the service is impeccable at Bouchon, and is a gold standard for hospitality. Breakfast was nothing short of one of the best meals I have ever had. The Eggs Benedict were perfect and the hollandaise was as flavorful as is to be expected. The French toast was full of flavor and is an elevated version of any I have had before. I'll make sure to stop by again on my next trip to Las Vegas.
1174	0	Pricey and not worth it. I guess I'm spoiled by the Wynn Buffet setup is a mess and i had to ask for replenishments cuz they were out of croutons and nacho cheese. this place is cluttered and the buffet areas are tight. the staff is hit or miss. will probably never return. the only highlight was buy one get one free for staying at MGM.
1175	0	Save Yourselves!!!!!!  The only reason for 2 stars is that their Coconut Margarita was so yummy that I promised myself I wouldn't give Cabo Wabo only 1 star.  But really....they're only deserving of 1 star....Cabo Wabo serves Tex Mex food....how can ANY Tex Mex taste bad?  Well, Cabo Wabo does it!   I ordered the fish tacos...but they were out of them!  So then I ordered the shrimp tacos....and again they were out of them!  But somehow they had the shrimp quesadillas, so that's what I went with.  What I got were these WET triangle things, that had no shrimp and basically just alot of wet cheese.  It was disgusting.  I couldn't eat it....and I eat anything Tex Mex.    IF you come to Cabo Wabo (and I would really think hard about it) my advice is to just sit at the bar and have a couple margaritas.  Thankfully they don't screw that up.  Don't eat here though.  Eat your Mexican at Dos Caminos at Palazzo or Pink Taco at Hard Rock.
1176	1	Awesome place. Looks really cool, plates, silverware good presentation was all very unique and cool.  The food wasn't huge portion, but the taste is incredible. Fries, dessert and burgers were all so good. When we go back to Vegas, we are coming back!  Decent prices too!!
1177	1	Shake shack really is bomb dot com! Everyone has been raving about this place because they had it in New York, and after trying it, I see why! The burgers are really good, with their special sauce. The patty tastes fresh. The buns are sweet buns. It's just a perfect concoction of deliciousness. I would say I like this better than In-n-Out. Only thing is, maybe I was really hungry because I wanted another one right after having my first burger. But I held back and ate crinkle fries instead. I was full in the end but I will want to try the Shroom burger next time. Shakes are also good by the way!   Try this if you come to Vegas!
1178	1	Unbelievably, Incredibly Good  I'll spare you a lengthy read.  I came up with the crazy idea to take my wife to one of her favorite restaurants for her birthday.  We flew from San Francisco to Las Vegas to have lunch here.  AND IT WAS TOTALLY WORTH IT!!  We will do it again.  It was our second meal there - every bit as good as the first.  The location is not great, but the food is utterly amazing.  EAT HERE.
1179	0	Used to LOVE MGM Grand to stay at but the employees have had it this past trip. I think they were all very stressed out due to the convention going on because we had poor service everywhere we turned. We were yelled at for using the wrong line at vip & we waited in line to check out for over 1 hour. We did enjoy the bartenders at Fiamma & so that is why I gave them a 2 stars. the attitudes of the employees at front desk would have seriously ruined our day if it hasn't been for Fiamma.
1180	1	I only eat pizza in two scenarios: When I'm in NYC and when I'm in Vegas--at Secret Pizza. This is LEGIT NY style pizza and it's absolutely amazing. I almost don't want to tell anyone else about it because it's so secret :). If you can find it, eat it. That's all there is to it.
1181	0	This review is not about the food. We didn't get to eat any of it. It's about the service, or lack thereof. When we walked in they said "It's a 20 minute wait, but you can have a drink and sit outside. We'll call out your name." A while later they claimed they had called our names even though we were practically right next to the host stand. When my friend complained about that the hostess basically shushed her. Then we were completely ignored by the wait staff when we finally were sat down. No one stopped by to even say "I'll be with you in a moment."  We finally said "Forget it" and took our business elsewhere.
1182	0	I have very mixed feelings about this hotel.  I booked an air+hotel deal through vegas.com which came out to under $500 for roundtrip flights from NYC and four nights at LVH, which sounded like a great deal at the time.  However, I recommend you shell out the extra money to get a hotel ON the actual strip, not "just off the strip."    The bad: First, other than the gas station across the street and convention center next door, there is absolutely NOTHING surrounding this place except shady and cheap hotels.  The walk to Encore alone is about a mile, which although doesn't seem like much, sucks because of the Las Vegas heat AND the fact that from there you still have to walk so much to get to where the life is- Venetian, Caesars, Cosmopolitan, etc.  Cabs are so expensive and the group I was with would end up caving and shelling out cab fare every night to get to and from restaurants/shops/clubs and they are not cheap!  The hotel is definitely dated and could use a bit of a facelift, but it isn't terrible.  The food in the hotel is obscenely expensive.  They had a Keurig coffee machine in the room, but it was $4 PER SMALL MEASLY CUP OF COFFEE.  Insane.  I ended up going to the cafe downstairs (called Fortuna) and paying $4.27 for a large coffee.  More bang for my buck I guess.  I'd recommend going across the street to the gas station for coffee, but I got lazy and didn't want to start sweating first thing in the morning.  The hotel also offers a go-green option where you opt out of having your room cleaned in exchange for your choice of either an $8 dining credit or $10 casino credit.  Out of the two days we did that, we got the voucher only once and when I called to complain they would not honor it saying my room "wasn't in the system" for going green, which was complete BS.  The good: The rooms were clean and a decent size.  We ate at the Benihana the first night which was good, it was a very big restaurant and the service was good.  There were always cabs outside so it was easy to get one.  There is a monorail station at the hotel too, which we did not use but what's the point when it doesn't service the strip?  We did not use the hotel pool until the last day and to my surprise it wasn't too bad.  The pool was a nice size and the bar had a 2-for-1 happy hour with good drinks and a DJ.
1183	1	One of the best burgers I've had in Vegas, hands down.   We had a bit of a wait (~15 minutes) before being seated, but it wasn't too bad. You can hang out in the middle of the mall and people watch until your buzzer goes off. The place feels kind of cramped once you're in there. At least it did for us. We were in a table in the middle, between the bar and some booths, but who's complaining? It's Vegas, and if you don't like crowds it sucks to be you.  A quick pitcher of beer set the dinner off right and we followed it up with a couple burgers (it IS the Burger Bar) that were cooked exactly the way we ordered them. My wife likes hers medium and I'm a burnt to a crisp kind of guy, which usually means one of us gets hosed. But not this time!  The shakes were awesome, too!
1184	1	Hard to find but worth the search!! Just don't come too hungry cuz you'll be frustrated if you get lost looking for this place. =)  NY style pizza with classic flavors - they really do it right here. $4 a slice of cheese, $5 a slice of pepperoni or 1 topping. Kinda pricey for a slice but well worth it!
1185	1	Everyone has to eat here at least once in their life!  Let's go straight to the point:  - MORE THAN ENOUGH portions and FULL of flavour - Excellent service: prompt, polite, and accommodating  - Clean inside and outside of restaurant  American classics with a twist. They're a bit pricey but it's so worth it! There's also a 24/7 location inside The Quad to satisfy your late-night munchies. The top item in the menu is the 'Sage Fried Chicken Benedict' and is highly recommended for you first-timers and the hollandaise sauce is the star of the dish. A good place to bring a date and pig out, feed each other, or share one item since the portions are huge.   COME HERE.
1186	1	Dope-ass burgers, yo.  Definitely one of the best fast-food burgers I've ever had. Eat your heart out In-N-Out. I was in Vegas for 3 days and I ate there twice and I'd have totally gone again, even though it was about a 30-40 minute walk from our hotel on the strip.  Cool vibe and delicious everything. The one criticism I have is that the menu isn't visible from the order counter. The menu is beside the queue where you wait to place your order, so you'd better decide what you want and remember it by the time you get to the front (remembering things in a, shall we say, compromised Vegas state of mind can be challenging at times).  The crinkle fries are delicious. I really liked them with the cheese on top.   Highly recommended. It's quintessential Vegas over-indulgence, but at an affordable price in an approachable atmosphere. This should be on your must-visit list when in Vegas, especially if you live on the West coast!
1187	0	A little bit of a let down:( the sweet potato fries were cold and had to be sent back. The chicken wings were also cold...the chili was good. The frozen hot chocolate was good but nothing to rave about. Service was nice and friendly  - nice location and atmosphere... However probably won't go back again. Very disappointed
1188	1	Me and my family went early around 730am or so and I have never been here before, the young gentleman who was really young was very swell and respectful and was caring that I had a infant and I thank him for being caring about him. Well mannered, our waiter was knowledgeable and very cool, I didn't catch his name but had a great sleeved tattooed on his right arm. The muffins are out of this world, they were so hot and fresh I was worried I want going to have room for my actual breakfast  The eggs bennidict were so delicious had a great zest to the sauce. The potatoes would have been great but there was a large amount of pepper and there specialty El Diablo of some sort of spice they created but ask them for easy on the spice. Other that great food good price. Had to take the remainder of my portion a home and I would go back
1189	1	While in Vegas I wanted to hit up one of Ramseys restaurants, so we dropped in to Burgr for lunch. We were seated fast and our waiter was amazing, he was on top of it the whole time, we never ran out of drink, and our apps arrived super fast. It's good to have such friendly service in a town that is running at 100 mph. We got the truffle fries, a must try. Sliders are great and the farm burger is on my list of favorites now. That duck bacon is pretty damn good.
1190	1	Service: No complaints! Server was very nice and attentive!  Atmosphere: Contemporary and nice! There is this neat sign near the entrance that lights up with fire   Food: One of the BEST places on the strip for a burger. My favorite is the Euro Burger. Their shakes are also very good. Be careful though the shake and burger combo is too filling for most. I suggest sharing your shake with another person.  Price: Reasonable. Around $15 for a burger. Unlike some other places, you do have to order fries separately (which runs around $8 to $13)   Overall: Highly Recommend!
1191	0	Slow service! Party of 4, We sat at our table at 10:30 and didn't leave until 12:30am! Since we got there our waiter neglected our table. We missed the bellagio fountain shows. We had simple orders.He only checked on us once. Food came out slow and at that point hard to enjoy. He attended all other tables but ours. He never acknowledged the fact or apologized. By midnight we were fed UP. He brought us a dessert but never said why. We didn't get to walk around the strip early like we planned, all our activities were pushed back and we went home at 4am. We spent our ONE night stay at serendipity for TWO hours. Ridiculous. By the end we hated being there we just wanted to leave. The waiter was a total buzzkill. We didn't even finish the dessert that looked good cause we wanted to go see the rest of Vegas. Not going back!
1192	0	Cost is ~ $40 for dinner.  The Chinese food wasn't very tasty and the carvery had very dry meat.  That's okay because they have a large selection.  They also had crag legs, both warm and cold, but the thing that grossed me out was when I saw one of the workers putting the cold seafood away with his bare hands!  At first, I thought he must be throwing them away, but after walking around to see where he was placing the crab legs in, I was shocked to see that he was putting them away and not throwing them away.  Now that may have happened just that one night, right?  Wrong!  I had to go back a couple days later because a few of my colleagues wanted a buffet and it happened to be one of the few w/in walking distance and was opened.  I thought...maybe that was just that one time....  Nope, I saw the same guy cleaning up with his bare hands..  If you want to get ripped off and have some "natural" crab leg tastes, then go here!
1193	1	First time here.... ordered through Gangnam prix fix menu for 2. Excellent quality and value for the price.  Favs were Haram Miso, Prime Kalbi, and Filet Mignon.  Also comes with fresh oysters, fried calimari and all the Korean side fixings. Can't wait to come again to try the Premium package!
1194	1	I've eaten at a lot of nice burger places in my life, living in SF (Umami Burger, Burger Bar, Roam Burger) and the burger I had at Holsteins was the best burger I've had. This is one of the best casual dining places to eat at the Cosmopolitan. It's on the second floor, across from Race Sports, China Poblano and Marquee. If you're thinking of eating at China Poblano, go here instead - it's 1/3 of the price and 3 times better.  There were a ton of creative burger options on the menu, as well as great looking milkshakes (probably equal to your entire daily caloric intake). Everyone raved about the Rising Sun burger and I've never had a Japanese twist to a burger before, nor a Kobe beef patty before. It was as good as the pictures look, and as good as everyone raves about. For $17, the bun was toasty and fresh, the teriyaki glaze was not too salty or overpowering, and the meat patty was moist and delicious. I couldn't really pinpoint the exact taste of the spicy mayo and furikake, but I'm sure it just complemented every bite. The crispy yam bits and tempura avocado added the perfect crunch.   My only complaint was the burger was a little hard to eat (it was super tall), and hard to get a little of everything in each bite, but nothing that would prevent me from ordering this again and again.  I paid $2 extra for onion rings which were perfectly fried, crispy, and fresh.  Each bite was perfection - my mouth is salivating thinking about this meal. I haven't eaten a lot of burgers in Las Vegas, but I don't need to try any other places - I'll just keep coming back here to repeat this burger and new ones.
1195	1	Finally found this spot on our last morning after checking out at the Cosmopolitan.  It was the perfect pre-flight meal to end our great stay at the hotel.  We had to hurry since our limo guy was gonna be waiting out front so I appreciated their 3 ready made pizzas sold by the slice.  In the 11am morning opening, they had 3 pizzas ready: cheese, pepperoni and a white cheese type pizza. That last white one was the best.  I think their slices generally cost $5.  I think its a must try for people staying in Cosmo.  It's on the 3rd floor right next to that glass elevator and the sushi restaurant.
1196	1	This place is great. I wrote a blog post on my experience here. If you're truly interested, you can go read it...  but in a nutshell, this place is a must for breakfast, lunch or dinner! We gluttons hit up this place for dinner and breakfast! LOL!  http://mintyfoodfanpage.wordpress.com/2012/07/01/poppin-the-bouchon-cork-on-a-popular-bistro/  HIGHLY recommend:   Breakfast:  * Moules-frites (for breffas???? yessssss doooo it! you won't regret it!). * Beignets...or as my friend and i call them, Beign-YAYS!!!!  Dinner: * Bone marrow (dude...like, is best! is best.) * Escargot! * Potato Salad (really? yes really....)  Would I come back? Oh my my, oh hell yes... ;)
1197	0	This was my 4th time staying at this hotel for a convention next door and I will never go back!  The last 3 years I have been downgraded from the Grand Room to a crappy room and all they offer me is a smoking room when I have complained.  I don't know why they take reservations they are unable to fulfill. This year the lady at the front desk double talked me and said we have been upgraded from the Grand room to a resort club room for an extra $10 per night.  When we got up to the room, it turned out to be another crappy room.  I immediately called down to the front desk to complain but was told they sold out of Grand rooms.  They considered me upgraded because my room was supposed to have robes, slippers & a free bottle of water, NONE of which was in our room.  I was told to call housekeeping about getting those items sent up.  We were also given gold keys to another room on another floor, which apparently had food and drinks but only open limited hours so we never did have a chance to see that.  So, thats what they considered an "upgrade" and tried to charge me more for.  I ended up calling the manager the next day and they took $30 off but to me it wasn't worth it at all.   The room was supposedly updated but it looked the same as it did the last 4 years, broken lighted mirror and not vacuumed.   Bottom line is I will never go back!
1198	0	Long wait. Over priced for the quality.  Only think good about the Saturday brunch was the guacamole and sour cream with the omelet. That was actually good. But not worth 27 bucks...  haven't been to a brunch buffet in awhile now I know why.... lmao won't be coming back...
1199	1	Oh, wow.  Where to start?  This is a Las Vegas institution.  When I was a dealer at the old Sahara, we used to go here after work at 3:00 AM for an omelet and champagne.  The fireside lounge is kitchy, old-school Vegas, but the bar staff are great and the mixologists build great drinks.  Oh, and did I mention the food is tasty, reasonably priced, and there's a lot of it?  If you're on the strip and need a good meal at a good price, or you want to sit back and relax in a nice lounge and enjoy a beverage, this is THE place to go.
1200	0	I came here recently on a HOT Tuesday night.  It was 99 degrees outside.  My friends and I were visiting from out of town, and after dinner, we decided to go to Serendipity 3.  We were curious about the hype.  We walked over to Ceaser's, and saw the line for ordering outside.  It was LONG.  We also placed our name for a seat inside...we were informed that it would be about a thirty minute wait.  We decided to sit instead.  and we got seated outside.  We decided to share a Double Frozzzen Hot Chocolate for 2 ($15! and there were 3 of us).  The double frozen hot chocolate comes with a scoop of chocolate ice cream and hot chocolate.  When we got it - we were disappointed with the size.  It seemed pretty small for $15.  It tasted like...chocolate milk, with chunks of ice.  We drank it quickly, since we were seated outside and it was hot.  HOWEVER, the next day, we went to a buffet and hat the frozen chocolate hot custard.  IT TASTED EXACTLY THE SAME.  Save your money - it's not really worth the hype...or money.
1201	1	With over 2,000 reviews and nearly 5 star rating, I'm not sure there's much more I could say that hasn't already been stated by others but I tell you what, this place is truly worthy of the raves and ratings.   Located about two miles passed Palace Station casino off Sahara Ave, The Egg & I is a wonderful breakfast/brunch place that is continuously packed. The service is quick, efficient and friendly. Our server Perry was right there ready to take our orders and food arrived shortly afterwards.   We had the prime rib benny, grandma's biscuits and gravy, corned beef hash and Island Favorite. Everything was delicious but I found the benny to be a bit salty for my preference....the banana nut muffin was sooo good and moist. I highly recommend this place and will be back here the next time I come to Vegas.
1202	0	Horrible customer service one star because u can't leave 0! I am a local and I had heard they had a real gold drink so I told my friend let's go try it. Upon arrival there was a long line and I saw a hostess talking to a co-worker and she had a big stack of menus in her hand since she was so busy talking I went to grab a menu and she gave me a dirty look. I looked over the menu and had some questions but since her demeanor was so terse I did not really want to speak with her again. Then she proceed to come behind me and yell, "Can u move up?!" I said please and thank you as if to tell her to be nicer she ignored me. Then she went over and it seemed she was talking about me and my friend to her coworker. I told her im leaving and I asked her what her name was and I believe she said Miranda or something with an M with a huge attitude!! I left and then try to make reservations for gordon ramsey over the phone with the resturant line for cesaers and the woman was like uhh is that a bar and I said no its a bar and grill by the forum shops. maybe they should inform u better and she said snidely well it's still considered a bar i asked her to please transfer me over and she had me on hold forever by the time I walked to Gordon Ramsey it wasn't busy and I got sat right away I had a better experience there. Cesaers needs to step up there customer service in the restaurants!! Especially at Serendipty!!!
1203	1	Oh! When I am sitting at home in New England, the Peppermill is what I dream of. Here's the deal.....the food is straight up Denny's. Only there is a TON of it. But who cares....toast your toes 'round the awesome water feature/gas jet in the Fireside Lounge. Order a giant Blue Hawaiian and admire the server's slinky, thigh-high slit evening gown. Zone out on the weird music videos on the little TV's.  Be hilarious and put three straws together to sip on someone's wacky drink across the way. And lighten up. This place is the last of a dying breed. The world today needs way more fake trees, mirrors, and awesome neon lighting.
1204	1	For most of my life I thought that In N Out burger was the best burger around.  That's until I discovered Holstein's Shakes and Buns.  This place might have the tastiest burgers in the world.  I ordered the Gold Standard Burger and i couldn't believe my taste buds! Simply delicious!   It is a little pricey but well worth it.  Their alcoholic shakes are pretty good as well.  I can't wait to go back to Vegas so that I can visit this place again.
1205	0	I liked the NY location, but this time in Vegas I thought the food wasn't very good but still liked the frozen hot chocolate.  We just ordered the cheese fries appetizer and unfortunately the chili was way too much on the sweet side for both my husband and I.  Also it had way too much cheese on the fries to the point where other than the few pieces that hung off the sides of the plate, 95% of the fries turned out to be soggy.  I think this place is a bit over hyped now.  Oh well, just go for the desserts maybe.
1206	0	My daughter had to come here during our recent visit to LAS to try their famous frozen hot chocolate! Not impressed.  Service extremely slow. Waitress delivered one item at a time.  With the exception of a hot dog my sister in law ordered, we all ordered ice cream.  We got our sundae 2nd and we were actually finished when the next order which was my daughter's frozen hot chocolate.  We were all done eating our ice cream and then came the hot dog.  We waited another ten -fifteen mins after she finished eating the hot dog to get her frozen hot chocolate.  They obviously need more staff.  With the high prices they can afford it! Won't be going back if I can help it! BTW, clean the tables before you seat someone!
1207	0	I remember MGM Grand as one of the best hotel/casinos on the strip, and now it's just, ugh, or eh.  Their buffet is horrific and their casino had this horrible vanilla smell mixed with like tobacco, just wasn't a good look.  I won't even mention the crowds just because I understand, it's Vegas in the middle of the afternoon, whatever.  My husband and I literally waited for our car at valet for as long as we spent eating at their buffet, but the valet attendant was very sweet, so 1 star for him. I just don't know what happened to this place.
1208	0	Open late for those who are looking for a bite to eat after a rachet night at Marquee but don't go out of your way to come here. It's not a very authentic Chinese restaurant but their Mexican cuisine might be better. We sat for 15 minutes before the server even came by and the restaurant was pretty empty. I tried the fried dumpling which was alright. It was fried like a crab Rangoon, with thick dumpling skin. The swallow a cloud noodle is just Hong Kong style wonton noodle soup. It has egg noodles, bok choy and wontons. The noodles were fine but no taste, the broth was bland, the wontons were mediocre. When pigs fly is a braised pork stuff steamed bun. The filling is sweet but decent. The rou jia mo sandwich is a more traditional dish that I was looking forward to. It's also a braised pork filling in a toasted bun shell but I was Sadly disappointed. The filling was so salty that it didn't even taste good. Not what I was expecting.
1209	1	Awesome place. Located in Mandalay Bay Hotel. Good beer list and extensive menu, with obviously their specialty is burgers. I built my own with a fried egg and I followed it up with a chocolate shake. The service was great. My favorite place for burgers and can't wait to go back.
1210	1	OMG our waiter was sooo nice! andd the foood was off the hook!!!! COME here after a night of partyin from the strip! SOOO good to have a nice home cooked meal lol. thats what it feels like. and the portions are HUGEEEE like ginormous! so sharing is caring and it can beeeeeeeee fun.
1211	0	Nothing special.  Just like other mentioned, they are like Denny's happened to be at the Bellagio.  If you are Denny's kind of person, this is a place for you but be ready to pay Bellagio price.   They prioritize seating for Mlife members but not for the hotel guests.  You will be asked to be in the same line with bunch of other random tourists just visiting for the conservatory.  Noisy!!  You are expected to get fed and go.   If you are staying at Bellagio, go to the Pool cafe which only opens for the hotel guests.  They are soooo much better than this Denny's.
1212	1	Arrived in Las Vegas from Los Angeles, got to our hotel and looked for a place to eat... They're the first one to pop up since our hotel is very close to this restaurant. Checked the reviews and decided right away to try the place... And guess what?! EXTREMELY SATISFIED!!! Especially that I am a big Korean Dish Lover!!! I enjoyed my Bulgogi Bibimbap! Really tasty! My family opted for some Bulgogi, Pork Belly and Brisket since they have a HAPPY HOUR SPECIAL!! This is such an awesome spot!! The meats are really tender and juicy! I loved the Pork Belly the most! The environment is really clean and the servers are really friendly and informative! They made sure that we know how the menu works. They also offer some Japanese dishes! But I recommend the Korean dishes more. The side dishes are also amazing, they are honestly to die for! I always go to Koreatown in LA and yes, it has the same quality as it is in KTown! Will definitely come back whenever I visit Las Vegas!!!
1213	1	Welcome to the Cheesecake Factory on steroids, dressed in expensive clothes, wearing $150 cologne, and driving a 2012 BMW 745li.  My girlfriend and I went to this place numerous times and it's no secret to any of our friends that this is one of our favorite places along the strip.  The food is decently priced, the drinks are expensive (it's the Strip after all), and the menu is ginormous.    I've never had a bad dish here.  Seriously.  And I've ordered all sorts of stuff on this menu.  The food portions are not for normal human beings, but for 9 foot tall giants who work out five hours a day.  If you like martinis then try the Calypso.
1214	1	Stellar restaurant in Vegas at the Palazzo (hidden on the 10th floor) where everything - from the bread to the desserts - is made with quality ingredients. This restaurant is great. 3 times I went there for breakfast or dinner and each time it was divine. Service is efficient. Staff is rather friendly and the food is definitely exceptional. 5 stars well deserved Mr Keller.
1215	0	My girlfriends who traveled and visited Las Vegas for bachelorette parties always bragged about this place. I think this place is pretty and very girly but nothing special about the food. I begged my boyfriend to take me here and we only shared the cookies and cream sundae. It's good but taste like a milkshake! I rather sit on the couch and buy a big blue bell carton tub and share it with my boyfriend. There's plenty of other gorgeous places with better food.   Oh yeah, if you're a fan of the show "Tanked" on Animal planet and coming here to look for the gumball fish tank, it's not here anymore. I read somewhere in the summer it got too hot and the fish got fried. Ouch! Poor fishies.
1216	1	I had been to the Shake Shack in NYC a few years back so I was so excited to see it in Vegas! I thought the staff was very friendly. The shakes are to die for! I recommend the strawberry. The burger tasted very fresh and homemade, which is my favorite. The fries are delicious too. This is a great place to order a meal and sit outside!
1217	0	Location and idea are great . Food is not all that The meat kinda lacks taste . But they have an open salad bar which has some good stuff.  Service is very slow and they refused to give us to go boxes !!! My husband was sick and didn't eat at all so I wanted to take his food to eat later , ended up going somewhere else later to eat. Definitely wouldn't go back
1218	1	First time having shake shack and it blew my mind! Anyone who says INN n out is better, is lying through they teef!  I'm going back to Vegas just for shake shack, not even kidding.   5/5 Original burger  5/5 BBQ burger 1/5 the jackpot , the cake tasted extremely stale 3/5 cheese fries
1219	1	Amazing burgers, that were both cooked and seasoned perfectly. The prices were a little bit on the expensive side for a burger, but it is not too much more than you would pay for a burger at any other sit down restaurant. The one area where they excel over other places is that they cook the burgers to your liking, but also have other foods that most sit down burger places wouldn't off. Additionally they have some incredible in house fruit flavored sodas.  The feel is not too bad, but it would be way better if it was located elsewhere, and not in a strip mall.
1220	1	I've been watching Gordon Ramsey since I could remember and I felt so honored to be able to eat at his restaurant. I'm a burger eater, I eat a burger everywhere I go and his burger is the best of the bet burgers I've ever tasted! To eat at the restaurant of the man who hosts master chef/junior, Hell's Kitchen, and more, is almost surreal. I definitely hope e I can eat there again
1221	0	Despite meeting Wilmer Valderrama, Mike Tyson, and Alonzo Mourning here, this place was an absolute nightmare.  We each paid $40 cover to cram onto the dance floor like packed sardines.  If I ever came here again, I'd stay outdoors the whole time.  Indoors is like driving in LA traffic...total buzzkill.
1222	1	Every time we go to Vegas, we must must must come to Bouchons. It is now tradition. We still have not made it in for brunch which I hear is fabulous but we have been here for dinner many times. Each time we are here, the staff is friendly, attentive and never leave you hanging. The service is excellent. The menu is also very very good. My fiance had their special 2 years ago which were braised beef cheeks and to this day he is always scouring menus looking for something similar. I loved their frisee salad with lardons and a poached quail egg. Their duck confeit is salty and good. Blood sausage is also very nice. They offer a wide range of items and their braided house bread is great. The prices are very reasonable for a nice Vegas restaurant like this. You definitely get what you pay for. I love this place and it will always hold a special place in my heart.
1223	0	Save your money and go somewhere else. This place is overpriced and the food is subpar. That 2 for 1 yard drink special is not a good deal or even a decent deal. You get two yard drinks in a souvenier plastic container for $40! You can find way better deals at any bar in Vegas. The food is so overpriced it's not even funny. Something like $20 for a quesadilla. If you like overy loud music and a party atomosphere and you don't care how much lousy quality food costs then you might like this place. Otherwise, I'd never go back.
1224	0	If u want to eat at a place similar to Dennys, but over priced?? Come to this place...  Wasn't satisfied with my food, nor my coffee...   Is a traditional American breakfast with a fancy name... Nothing else I can say about this place... not worth it...
1225	0	my girlfriends and i got on their guestlist so we were lucky for that because we didnt have to pay the cover. i would have been pretty pissed if i had to pay because i was not pleased. we went there on a friday night. it was PACKED. the dance floor was ridiculous. there was no room to move or to even get across. the only movement was people trying to get in and out of the dance floor. the music was good but we were sad we couldnt even dance to it because there was no room! drinks are expensive so preparty beforehand! haha we left and went club hopping to see what else we could find...
1226	1	Highly recommend getting there before they open at 5:30pm. We got there at 5:15pm and sat in the car, then slowly a line of people started to form. We literally got a table when they open at 5:30pm. Service was amazingly quick and attentive. The food arrived within 5 to 10minutes. The price is on the higher end for Thai food- average about $15 to $30 for entree, but it's well worth it. The menu is very extensive and it's sorted by the region of Thailand.    The garlic prawn comes with 8 generous pieces and flash fried with garlic seasoning. It was delicious and the shrimp was crispy. The prawn was deshelled therefore consumption is very convenient.   The crispy duck with the noodle was one of my favorite. The duck was tasty with a crispy skin. The flat rice noodle was slightly pan fried and complimented the duck really well. Pretty much, it's  similar to the Chinese chow fun (pan fried rice noodle) atop with crispy duck.   The Thum ka noon was minced pork with jackfruit. We randomly ordered this and it was interesting. It would be really good if it's eaten with rice. Overall, the food was very well seasoned and I cant stop burping after the dinner. I will definitely come back and try different entree. I'm curious how good a simple pad thai or pad see ew would taste in here?
1227	1	All I need to say is Beef Wellington and Sticky Toffee Pudding! WOW!  Both are signature Gordon Ramsey dishes and now I know why. The Beef Wellington is extremely tender!  Unfortunately, it was my husband's dish so I only got a couple of bites.  I got the 24 oz. ribeye and while it was good, the Beef Wellington was a lot better.  We, as a group of 6, was so FULL, we shared just one toffee pudding. Next time, I'm getting my own no matter how full I mean. Deliciousness.
1228	0	Our servers were nice but everything else, not so much. Had to wait forever for a seat. We were told 25-30 mins. But it was closer to 45-50 mins. Once we got a seat, we had to ask to move because we were by a back door where people kept entering and the wind was just making it a pain. Food was bland and took a while. Burgers were burnt and the bun on mine just fell apart to the point that I just gave up even eating it. This was our first experience here, and most likely our last.
1229	0	My friend and I came here for lunch on a whim.  We had no idea the waiters are supposed to be sarcastic, rude, and insulting until our waiter shouted, in the middle of our meal might I add, "You guys need some napkins?"  and threw a huge wad of napkins in my face.  I thought they were going to make us do the dishes next.   The food was gross and it was served with a plastic-wrapped fork and napkin, KFC style.    It was a memorable experience.  I'd go back if I secretly hated my eating companion(s) and wanted them to be humiliated.
1230	1	It was late night and my bf and I just arrived in Vegas. We haven't eaten and I'm hangry. We decided to grab a quick bite and remembered the goat cheese burger we had here last time was delicious, even though I don't like cheese.   When we arrived, I was surprised that there was a line at this hour, but we were seated within 10 mins cause we opted to be seated at the bar. We were told the burger would take 20 mins to make after we ordered. 40 mins later, we were still waiting. Our pork belly "hot" pocket was cold when it arrived. By now, I was about to throw a hissy fit. Right before I do, our truffle burger magically appears and perfectly cut in half to share. First bite in, my anger goes away like those hangry Snicker commercials. I apologized to my bf for every side-eye I gave him during the wait. Even without the truffle aioli and foie gras creme that makes the burger extra flavorful, the patty itself was so juicy. It's all I ever want when I crave a burger! Simple but juicy! One of the best burgers I have ever eaten!  Ramsey can make one hell of a burger!
1231	1	They opened pretty recently so we were the only folks there for awhile. Their sauces (ponzu, sweet, or spicy) are yummy, but even if you're not a fan, their meat is perfectly marinated already (we got the bulgogi). All the waiters/esses are super cute and helpful, and they will notice if you are leaving your meat on the grill for a long time and adjust the fire level for you accordingly. The cheese wontons were delicious, and so was the honey pancake. Although, don't expect it to be textured like western pancakes- it is much sweeter, stickier and eggier.
1232	1	The best Thai food I had in long time.  I started with Sa-Tay of chicken.  Very good pickle vegetables and a delicious peanut sauce.  I enjoy it immensely.  My girlfriend had the Tom Yum Kai.  She really enjoyed the soup.  I was lucky and got to try it before she ate it up.  I agree, the soup was great. I had the drunken seafood noodles with spice level of 7.  It was spicy but satisfying.  The food was delicious and the spicy sauce was incredible.  We came pretty late but service was still very good.  Definitely, will be back again.
1233	1	Not so secret as people would say but the pizza is really good.  Open 24 hours and I found it to be the busiest after club hours.  There will be a long line through their hallway and out into the hotel.  I won't wait but I've seen people wait over an hour for the pizza.  Thin crust pizza with a tasty sauce and they never skimp on the cheese.
1234	1	I love it here. Expensive but worth it. Service is awesome and quality is amazing. They even gave us ice cream macarons which are heavenly. I would definitely come back and tell all my friends. I was really happy when i left because it was a great experience for us!
1235	1	What a great place! Came here last night with a group of 8. The waitress split our bill for us didn't seem too thrilled about it but dealt with it. I ordered the Bulgogi burger and it was probably the best burger ive ever had. Juicy, spicy, sweet delicious. Had a fried egg and kimchee on it. Weird but definitely worth it. Also an order of onion rings. Although pricy when they came out there was a huge plate of them and they were perfectly crisp and totally yummy.  Others had plain burgers, salad, Philly cheese steak spring rolls. Everyone left happy and full. Oh, did I mention milkshakes?
1236	1	The Toro beef was amazing. It was so good! The waiter was very nice. My friend got the ramen noodles and it looked really good. I would highly recommend the lunch special for someone looking for food in vegas. Side dishes are amazing! Washrooms are nice.
1237	0	If you're planning on paying for a buffet on the Strip, allow me to convince you otherwise, because it is definitely not worth it. However, if you find yourself with some complementary buffet vouchers, let the Wycliff flow! Most of the food here is standard buffet, which is to say, bad, but there are some palatable items to be had if you look carefully enough. I went with the gyros, available near the salad bar. Also acceptable-looking were the salads themselves. For dessert, I hunkered down for some frozen instant pudding (or gelato, as they call it around these parts), which tasted good enough. As an aside, I noticed a lot of people putting their faith in the raw bar here, and I haven't heard news of a salmonella outbreak, so that's something. Sparkling wine is complementary, so drink up!
1238	1	Excellent quality meats. I've been to many Korean BBQ in different states, but this by far the best Korean BBQ. Not to mention their prices are very reasonable compare to other Korean BBQ I've been to.  Definitely will be coming back here again and again.
1239	1	5 star service from beginning to end.  The waiters took great care of us, helped answer all of our questions, and were incredibly knowledgeable.  You're going to pay a great deal, but it's a great meal and experience.  The steaks were cooked perfectly, the drinks were great, and the sides were amazing! Be ready to drop a great deal of money, but when you're in Vegas and with a name like Gordon Ramsay attached to it, you know what you're getting into.
1240	0	Ate at Cravings on my last trip to Vegas.   I have been to Cravings before, but this time was a bitter disappointment.  You go through the normal buffet queue to arrive at your table and I found that everything had changed since my last visit.  They had waiters/waitresses serving tables, but they have basically been reduced to bus persons.  You have to fetch your own coffee, orange juice or alcoholic beverages.  The food was generally acceptable, but no where near where you'd go out of your way to eat there.  Mirage used to have an outstanding buffet, but I would only eat there now if I was staying at the Mirage and frankly you'd be better off going to Bellagio.
1241	0	If you want typical buffet food, semi warm this is your place. Had a good variety of pizza, salad bar, Italian, Chinese, Mexican and Spanish food with a dessert bar as well but it was all just ok. Definitely was not worth the $32.99 a person. We won't eat here again during our stay. On a positive note our server was very friendly and attentive to our drinks.
1242	0	What a shame. My group of 6 came here for brunch on a Sunday by recommendation of my fianc. He said it was "amazing" when he came several years ago. I guess all that's gone downhill now, because he was one of the most disappointed guests at our table.  Food-- The food at our table, as described by myself and my friends, ranged all the way from "Mmmmm!" to "I regret wasting an hour of my life waiting for this." The people at our table who ordered the strawberry cream waffles, fried eggs benedict, and breakfast quesadilla seemed happy with their meal. Two of us (including myself) ordered The Hangover Omelet. On both dishes, the potatoes were BURNED to a CRISP. AND they weren't even hot!!! I'm talking dry, black, LUKEWARM potatoes. Simply not edible however I tried. The French fries, which were put into the omelet itself, were soggy and rubbery enough to confirm that the dish had been sitting out for a while before being brought to our table. My fianc ordered a side of black beans with his dish. The beans came out late, after he asked where they were. And they came out COLD. We notified the server, who then MICROWAVED them. Are you kidding me? We ALWAYS try our best to be good and friendly customers when we go out, but this was beyond disappointing. The only part of the meal that I actually enjoyed was the Caf Serendip. It wasn't bad. I'm starting to think the only thing anyone should order from this place is dessert.  Service-- After waiting about 30 minutes to be seated, we had to wait another 15 or so for the attention of a server. After our order was taken, it took yet another 30-45 minutes until we asked where our food was. Our waitress was not friendly and spoke very quietly (which is not good in a relatively loud environment). I can only guess that she was having a bad day. The kicker came when we got the check and saw that the cold beans, which were then microwaved, cost $7. $7 for a little itty bitty 8oz cup of beans that weren't even made properly. In most establishments, staff will at LEAST tell you how much a side dish of something will cost when you order it. On the bright side -- the only reason I am giving 2 stars instead of 1 is that the waitress did offer to take the beans off the check, which we gratefully accepted.  I would not come back here again.
1243	0	two stars because seems mean to give this a one-star. I'm sure much of my review is due to an anti-buffet bias, but I really expected a lot more because Vegas buffets are so legendary. we got a free meal as part of the Mystere tickets (incredible show, btw) but I would have rather paid for a better meal. I think it's normally $32pp  there aren't as many stations as I expected. The best one was the BBQ area, the brisket was really good. the desserts were just okay. some of the fruit fillings on the tarts tasted canned.  while I'm sure there are those who appreciate quantity over quality, IMO even as a freebie for the Mystere show it's not worth it
1244	1	just great freaking pizza! i am from nj and ny and I know pizza. i don't even particularly care for sicilian and theirs is great. They make their own sausage and meatballs. The best pizzas we have had were the meatlovers, the large pepperoni and mushroom, and the CORNER slices of the white sicilain with sausage , peppers and onions. Absolutely heaven no matter what time of day you go. only complaint is that a soda is 4$. its a fountain soda. we got smart and like a nj pizzaria, we bring a 2 liter and sit on the couches outside. so good so damn good! id put it up against L&B spumoni gardens in Brooklyn and Benny Tudinos in Hoboken. has pinball and leaves the par cheese out for you to use.
1245	1	Sad fact: I've lived in Vegas for over seven years, and it's only recently that I had a chance to eat here. Sad, I know, but with the Riviera closing recently, the lure of "Old Vegas" got me in the mood to try more classics.  Worth the wait.  The place scream '80's neon decor. It's a lively atmosphere with music videos on the TVs. Without a doubt, the vibe of the place was the biggest appeal to me here. I tried one of their benedicts, and the flavor had me charging through my meal (it can be said in my defense that I was very hungry that night). Again, I sampled their Bloody Mary, and that was "Yes" and "Please".  I did not, however, sample their Fireside Lounge this outing, but I did go in to check it out. I love their fire pit. It's really impressive, and now I have to find an excuse to go dress up and experience it proper.  This is a classic restaurant. My only regret is not visiting it sooner now that I've been able to experience its food and appeal. While I have grumbled in the past that Vegas doesn't respect its history, I hope they have the smarts to leave this landmark location alone, and let it continue to do its thing.  I can see this becoming one of my new favorites.
1246	0	I came to Vegas for work during April of 07. A friend mine took me here because of a good past experience when they were part of the Aladdin. What a freakin mistake! Well, a man near by our table suddenly stopped breathing.  The paramedics came and let's just say the people who handled this were NOT thinking. They evacuated nearby tables (ours of course) without being relocated to anywhere else. We were just standing like dumb asses and we couldn't go back to our tables (which we had our valuables). How the heck were we supposed to eat standing up?! I've written a letter to their VP of food and beverage, Mr. Rick Holliday end of April. No response to date yet.   Oh yeah, the man was ok but we weren't so fortunate.  The food wasn't great and the experience made it that much worse. Note: this is the only place I have given 1 star
1247	0	I was looking around for some place to have lunch before going to the Shark reef Aquarium and I just happened to pass this place. They had their menu on the outside and I saw they had a lobster roll. That is all I needed. So I went to the hostess and got seated. I was told a server would be by shortly. Um not what happened. Now the place was virtually empty and I noticed my server had looked over and saw me sitting there waiting but he never came up and offered me a drink or anything. He just kept staring at me and carried on conversations with his co workers. It made me very uncomfortable. Then he finally comes up and asks me if I am ready. He offers no apology for the wait or the fact that he saw me sitting there and did nothing. He did not ask me if I wanted a drink or anything like servers normally ask first he just asked me if I was ready and had a huge attitude when he asked. The annoying tone in his voice was like I had kept him waiting while I stared at the menu forever or something like that. His attitude surprised me considering I knew what I wanted from the second I walked in and I was the one who was kept waiting but ok. I also wanted to get to the Shark Reef aquarium before I started collecting my social security so if anyone should've been annoyed it should have been me. I ordered my food and guess what more waiting. Again he was too busy doing his own thing to go check on my food. It took almost 30 minutes to get my food. I know it was not the kitchen for one thing the lobster is served cold so is not like they have to cook the lobster and heat it up or anything and my side was coleslaw. How long does that take? I had already thought it was a mistake coming there because my server acted like a complete asshole but it was even worse after I tried this pitiful excuse for a lobster roll. It was disgusting. After I picked through my food I waited and waited for the server to bring me my check. I had to flag him down at some point because if not I would have sat there forever. Well wanting my check must have been a problem because Mr. Attitude acted even more stuck up when I flagged him down and asked for my check. Needless to say after $23 for that lunch I felt leaving unsatisfied and downright stupid for wasting my time and money there. The food was shitty and the customer service was even shittier. others many have a better experience but personally for me I will not ever waste my time and energy here again. Mandalay Bay and Vegas itself has WAY too many superior options for dining for me to waste me time where I am clearly not wanted.
1248	0	I would not come back to this place even if it was free.  I was very disappointed, I really wanted to like this place.  Our waitress was very nice.  My disappointment came when we had to wait more than 10 min for anyone to come through with meat, and if they did come, it was because we had to ask our waitress to send someone over.    The food was tasteless, and all I had to eat was a Caprese (look-a-like) salad because I could not bare eat any of the meat.  I would not waste my money coming here.
1249	0	Not impressive. I went here for dinner with 5 other people and the line to pay for our buffets was enormous, but moved quickly. We were seated and a server promptly took our drink order. However, when she got back to the table, she had the diet and regular sodas all mixed up.  The buffet area is set up according different food "cultures": Japanese, Mexican, American, Middle Eastern, etc. Some of the food looked absolutely horrifying. My dad saw them mixing in snow crab legs with the king crab legs. Lots of stuff looked like it had been sitting out for awhile...  I found the only edible food in the Middle Eastern portion of the buffet. It had some couscous and fresh tomatoes sliced in half and topped with some sort of veggie concoction. It also had tandoori chicken and some really good vegetables.  I would avoid most of the meat here. Did not look appetizing at all...   They did have made-to-order crepes at the dessert station; I had a bananas foster crepe and it was pretty good.  Would I pay $30 to eat here again? Heck no. Especially if you can't eat much. If you're going to try this place out anyway, check around for coupons -- we found $5 off coupons available online.
1250	0	We paid I believe $15 per person for breakfast. I barely found anything to put on my plate and whatever I did find, i didn't enjoy it. Breakfast is supposed to plentiful and amazing food! Didn't find either of those here. I would suggest paying a little more and going somewhere nicer with a lot more food, I mean it IS a BUFFET! Kids pay $12.
1251	0	My boyfriend and I stopped in for lunch today. We wanted to see what all the fuss was about. Neither one of us was impressed. I had to choke, literally choke down my sliders, then was nauseous the rest of the evening. Buns, were soggy, meat tasted old. Fries were of the frozen variety, not evenly cooked or seasoned. We paid roughly $10 for the #2 and shared it.. let's just say I can get a steak and lobster for that price in town and not be sick or disappointed. We can say we've  scratched it off of our bucket list, but will not be back.
1252	0	Do not come here! The security guards harass you, especially if you are a pretty girl! They gave one of my friends a hard time getting in just to have the excuse to feel on her. After that we called a manager and he denied the whole thing and said that she was being aggressive towards security and then didn't let her to go in the club. Some of us still went in and it was extremely crowded, not enough space to dance. Drinks are $25 plus. Do yourself a favor and spend your vegas night elsewhere.
1253	0	A. Drinks are easy to obtain without utility of a Fullback to get to the bar B. No prob getting in C. If you like being surrounded by Cali Flips, this is the spot for you D. West coast vibe is prominent which is a major negative   I will not hit again.
1254	1	Hash house has the best chicken and waffles.. My husband and I always take our friends here when they come in from out of town. No matter what time of day you go here the food is amazing and the portions are enormous... We always order our own food and take home 3/4 of our meal as that's how huge the portions are. If you're in town stop by here and order the chicken and waffles..
1255	1	LOVE LOVE LOVE!!! Thomas Keller, you are amazing. This is a MUST try brunch place in Vegas; I will take this quality food over 3+ hours of waiting for a buffet anyday. And this being my second Thomas Keller experience, and just as good as the first (Fleur de Lys, San Francisco), I am determined to try every Thomas Keller restaurant possible in my lifetime.  We had a 10-15 minute wait on a Saturday morning Christmas, but it was nice because we lounged around and looked at their menu beforehand. We did have a service problem. But I still gave them 5 stars for the way they remedied it. They brought out one of our orders before the other... WAY before. I think we waited a good 15 minutes for our present order to get cold before the other one came out. However, like all top-notch French restaurants, impeccable service rendered the mistake to practically nothing. The service:  - waiter apologized many times - brought out assorted fruit plated in a cup by the chef - offered us drinks from the bar on the house - the restaurant manager herself brought out the dish and apologized - the dish was put on the house, cutting our bill in half  Service, service, service. They are AHHHMAZING, polite, speedy, attentive, and friendly. Except for that period of time where our waiter was a bit MIA, everything else was flawless.  I was a bit skeptical about their chicken and waffle, because... chicken and waffles? Thomas Keller? Most popular item on the menu? ...uhh, come again?  I was very happily proven wrong when we ordered it anyways. Chicken is usually too dry and waffles are usually too sweet. This chicken... I don't think I've tasted chicken so flavorful WITHOUT the gravy or waffles so flawlessly textured and flavored... add some of their gravy to your chicken, and some butter and syrup to your waffles... I could die eating this for breakfast, lunch, and dinner every day for the next year.  I got the crab special... I forgot what it was called, but it was a weekend special of crab, macaroni, and cheese, baked and topped with scrambled eggs and black truffle hollandaise sauce (black truffle anything, HOLLA!). I ate every bite even when I was stuffed up to my esophagus because it was that good.  Get their orange juice, by the way. Super fresh and a perfect balance of flavor to your meal. Judging by the flavor of the orange juice, I'd assume their mimosas to be great as well.  Ambience was wonderful. This restaurant is located near the Venetian hotel check in. You take a separate elevator up to a different, more secluded lobby by the pool, and the decor inside the restaurant is classic and has windows that look out to scenery.  Great service, nice ambience, and AMAZING food... I will most definitely be back the next time I'm in Vegas.  Psst... check out Bouchon Bakery downstairs after your brunch and take something to go. You won't regret it!
1256	1	As vegetarians, we ADORE this place. Nearly everything on the menu can be made vegetarian or vegan even if it doesn't say so. Just ask your server!   We had our first date here and every year we return to re-enact that beautiful evening.   Our favorites:   Crispy Rice (vegetarian style) -- truly amazing flavor, we could eat this all night. It actually paired very well with the  Papaya Salad (vegetarian version) -- delicious! Our only disappointment this most recent visit is we asked for Medium spicy and it was completely mild.   Mangoes & Sticky Rice -- luscious perfection! Never disappoints. I've been experimenting with making my own but they really have it down. The crunchy fried mung beans on top are a crispy balance to the chewy rice and ripe mango, and I have no idea how to replicate those at home!   I understand there are some low reviews from tourists visiting Vegas who may have had an uneven experience and felt disappointed, but as residents of Vegas who have dined here many times as well as at all the other Thai offerings in town, this place is the deal. If you had a less than spectacular time, try again. It is so worth it!   And yes . . . the parking lot is a little sketchy sometimes, but this has no bearing on my tastebuds. Go with a friend!
1257	1	Once again, Bachi burger does not disappoint! Today we had the sweet potato fries to start, then the chef's special: Spicy Miso Burger and the Lonely Bird burger.   I almost want to retract my previous review of the Ronin being the Death Row burger. The spicy miso burger is definitely a knife-and-forker. The lonely bird was a picker-upper and held it's own. I swear everytime I come here and think that I had already tried the best burger, something new proves me wrong. Never a dull moment in the food adventure at Bachi Burger. Thanks to Melissa our server today for the recommendation! You guys are awesome!
1258	0	worst Brazilian food ive ever had!! majority of meat was dry, hard, flavor less and BURNT. not charred, but burnt!!! for the price of this place i expected better food. servers were polite, but some meat cutters/servers are rude and seemingly arrogant. I went here for a prebirthday celebration and it was definitely a disappointment. Only reason for 2 stars is the salmon because it was delicious
1259	0	I'm not too satisfied with Serendipity. I ordered their coffee (very expensive, but reasonable for Vegas) and their strawberry cheesecake dessert (insanely expensive and super fatty/not worth it). The reason I give it 2 stars is b/c of their poor service. It's a horrible place. It took us 10 minutes to get seated for 2 people, 10 minutes to even order, and they GAVE US THE CHECK 5 minutes into the dessert. What the heck is that service? It's common courtesy to give the check when requested, unless it's a fast food place I can understand. Overall, I'm not going back. Nor should you.
1260	0	Great food. The service is extremely slow. Nothing happens fast here. 10 minutes to get a drink from when I sat down. The meat servers do not come around often if you sit on the patio. Servers are not motivated to earn tips. 35 minutes to the pay ythe bill. So many better places to go
1261	1	i am a fan! too bad this place is in vegas.. very pricey but understandable.. they have a fried portabello mushroom inside the shack stack so you can see why they charge what they charge.. it's not just patty cheese veggies n bread.. they fancy.. you cannot compare this to in and out because they are different.. you can compare this to five guys and they totally kill em.. the shakes are weird though b/c it's just like in n  out.. not cold enough.. we also had the cheese fries.. YUM YUM! cant wait to get my hands on this place again
1262	0	I should've checked Yelp instead of listening to all the hype. While on vacation there were a few places my friends and I had heard about quite often and wanted to check out - Pink's was one of them. Located right in our hotel, we figured it'd be one of the better places to eat during our trip, but ... not so much.  Maybe it's because I've been spoiled by all the good food here in San Francisco, but Pink's didn't strike me as anything special. Most of the items seemed to be pretty similar, mostly consisting of chili, bacon, onions, cheese, and other meats; not a ton of variety overall. Though I have to say, the portions-to-price ratio was pretty good - you get a gigantic, filling meal for about $10 or so, and unless you have a monstrous appetite you won't need a second hot dog.  As for the food itself? Average. Even though most of my friends and I were feeling ravenous I think only one out of nine of us managed to finish, and it wasn't really because of how filling the hot dogs were. Sure, they're packed to the brim with condiments and other things, but it's mostly standard fare. I actually felt kind of sick and bloated for a few hours afterward, and I certainly didn't feel like finishing the leftovers after looking at it later than day.  Unfortunately for people thinking they'll get to sit indoors and have a hot dog in an AC-dominated environment, the only seating is outdoors in the hot, hot Vegas sun, with only a few tables sitting underneath a bit of shade. It's a pretty small location, so if it's crowded you might just want to bring everything back to your room instead. It'll be less messy that way anyway.  Overall I don't think Pink's met the hype at all. Perhaps because the original is in Los Angeles and not in Vegas, and in addition I've had better hot dogs at local joints (sorry!). It's probably worth a stop if you're in Vegas, but don't go there expecting the best hot dog you've ever had. You'll only set yourself up for disappointment in the end.
1263	0	For 35 $ per person you would think that it comes with great service for a buffet which it did not, I just don't understand why people starve to serve good food but employ those who put their hard working reputation on the line. And In this case is the manager once again who left my family waiting in front after a long standing in line. How hard is it to put 2 tables together ? But it is easier for him to seat 20 other people down. Once again People tend to ignore seniors and kids. Anyway I will not visit this place again.
1264	1	Honestly what better way to combat a hangover in Vegas than a cheesy pizza loaded with meats and veggies...hot and ready to order? Yeah, nothing. This review wont be long I swear...because I want you guys to just find this place....on the 3rd floor of the Cosmopolitan...exit out the elevator to your left...then quickly to your right...spot the hallway after the Jaleo Restaurant and make a right down the hallway..... and see the glorious yet tiny SECRET PIZZA place. It's everything your heart desires. Whatever you want, order it- This place is where dreams come true. I was craving a good pizza place, absent of the fancy Vegas pretentiousness and I found it. Made to order. Orgasmic. You gotta do it guys...
1265	1	This pizza is BOMB, period.   IMO, it's kinda cool that it's pretty much a hole in the wall and that they don't advertise it. One of those exclusive things where you have to know about it through word of mouth. Almost as if it were my own little secret.  As far as for you negative Nancys comparing this plave to NY. Get a grip, it's not New York, it's Las Vegas. You will never get NY pizza anywhere but NY. It's like going to NY to a casino (idk if they have them or not) and say well these arn't like Las Vegas...duuhhh.
1266	0	PSA For All Thieves: GO ON AHEAD AND DO YOUR WALLET OR PURSE SNATCHING HERE. THE SECURITY DOESN'T INVESTIGATE AT ALL.   After waiting in that enormous line to check in, I just wanted to relax and play some slots. Literally, the first machine we sat down at, some guy comes sweeping by and grabs my purse. He was gone in an instant. I notified the slot machine attendant who lazily walked over to the security desk. They couldn't have been less concerned. The security guard questioned the witness who saw the man take my purse, but not once did he ask her name or contact information. They never even asked me what my wallet looked like!  Now the runaround began for us. We went to go talk to the casino investigator who wouldn't even check the cameras. We were told what they caught was "random." Yeah right. The investigator told us that we needed to file a police report for them to do anything.   Next we were sent to the hotel manager, Alice C.  I have never encountered such an incompetent manager. All she offered to do for us was call the police. After 45 minutes of waiting on hold, Alice asked if we wanted to go "enjoy ourselves in the casino" instead of calling the police. I was livid at this point because she was so insensitive to make a comment like that and kept referring to "the lost item."  No! It was freaking stolen. Finally, I got ahold of the police and got a police report number. They said that it was the MGM's JOB TO INVESTIGATE. When I told Alice that she said, "Oh, do you want to file a report with us?" I about lost my mind when she said that!  So the investigator comes up to the front desk where we are and brings some useless paperwork for us to fill out. He starts filling out a report too but has YET TO ASK ME WHAT MY PURSE LOOKED LIKE (he never did, btw). My husband asked, "why weren't you filling out that report an hour ago when we talked to you?!" He mumbled some answer like, "I was going to after you guys left." Yeah right. They couldn't be less concerned.   We never heard from anyone regarding my purse again.   Later, a bartender said that stuff gets stolen all the time there. Good to know.   So like I said before, thieves have at it at the MGM. They could care less!
1267	1	This was a great dining experience. Although the wait was long (about 1.5 hours for a party of 7), the food and staff made up for it.  We got the fries, jalapeo poppers, and their creme brle milkshake on top of the burgers.  I got the Euro Burger but all of them looked amazing.   The staff was friendly and fun and made our experience enjoyable!
1268	1	Went there for the first time, tonight, with a friend. In a word, awesome! Had the number 55, which was beef and I think Cilantro and some other stuff I can't remember, but it was amazing. Had the yellow curry with chicken as well, both dishes done to a number 2 out of 10 heat level. I'd been told they really crank up the heat and so we went for a low number. Turns out I could have gone up several notches with that, but even at level 2 there was definitely some spice and flavor.   Anyway, great food, friendly and prompt service, and I will absolutely be going there again.
1269	0	Yesterday stopped by for quick light dinner.  Ordered turkey sandwich with  avocado, tomato, and greens.  Also ordered kale salad that include goat cheese and grains mixed in.  Sandwich was dry hard and salty so it was hard to consume.  The salad was hard and flavorless.  Sad...paid $49 for these food and didn't really the food.
1270	1	Its a value and great deal.  That being said, a foursome (2 couples) with eats and drinks is going to be about $120.  $40 bucks a person, if you want to be like super stuffed.  Otherwise, you can probably get away with $30 a person (tip not included with that price).  Great food, great service, great AYCE Korean BBQ in Vegas.   Been here 2x and still loving it.
1271	1	This place continues to be AWESOME.  We went with some friends and the food is amazing, the service is amazing and the drinks, WOW....  But I can also say this for the burgers, the sweet potato fries, everything here is amazing.  It is a little more pricey then your normal burger joint, BUT THIS IS NOT A NORMAL BURGER JOINT.  This is a place with QUALITY food and service.  If you have not been then you don't know what you are missing.  You can get a make your own burger the way you like it for about $15-$17 but it is worth every cent.  If you are looking for a cheap burger place then you will get what you pay for, but if you want a place that is QUALITY through and through, then this is a place for you.    They do get crowded and they do not take reservations, however you can call 30 minutes before you go and have your name put on the list so when you arrive you only have about a 5 minute wait instead of just showing up and waiting a long time.
1272	1	Better known as "the establishment responsible for robbing me of half a day's worth of tourist time."    How, you ask? Well...  (Cue dream harp flashback sequence music.)  We started the day off with every intention of being productive. Woke up at a decent enough time (especially considering that we were on vacation mode), and headed to brunch at the Hash House.   Loved the dcor (sleek and modern), and was tickled by their slogan - "Twisted Farm Food" (farm fresh food with a 'twist').  After perusing the menu, I knew immediately that I wanted the Fried Chicken & Waffles Tower. How could I not?! I mean, a TOWER of fried goodness! I shot down my hubby's attempt to share an order, determined to take down the tower (and save the princess?) on my own.   My dish arrived, and I was in foodie heaven. Laced with crispy bacon pieces, these waffles were no ordinary Eggos. And the fried chicken. Oh. My. Goodness. Infused with sage and fried to absolute perfection -- I would have no qualms with eating THESE chicken pieces out of a red and white bucket with my bare hands! Thankfully, we were provided with silverware so this was not necessary. I used my knife and fork to tackle my fried food tower like a civilized person thankyouverymuch.  As could have been predicted, I was defeated by the tower of gluttony. Though undoubtedly delicious - I couldn't eat another bite. In hindsight, I probably should have agreed to split an order. Alas, I had once again become a victim of 'eyes bigger than tummy' syndrome.   Here's where the details get sketchy. We headed home (or did we go for Boba first?), and somehow made it to one of the bedrooms. We each felt the need to (falsely) assure one another that we were not going to fall asleep. I wanna say we put in a DVD. I wanna say my sister and I were even munching on some Swedish Fish as an attempt to further perpetrate our 'we're totally normal' act.   I wanna say we succumbed to food coma pretty instantaneously.   It must have been a pretty sad sight when my mom walked in to find all of us completely unconscious -- my sister and I laid out on the bed (with an, ahem, EMPTY Swedish Fish bag between us), and our respective men sprawled out on the floor (one of them with his belt and pants button undone to accommodate his fullness).   Oh, and I should mention - this was FIVE hours later. We had taken a FIVE HOUR midday siesta, thanks to our Hash House feast. We were forced to throw in the towel on any plans we originally had for the day, and made a pact to one another that we would not let this happen again.  (Music screeches to a halt.)  Until, that is, we met the 30-inch pizza. Alas, a story for another day...
1273	0	So watching them make the noodles is very cool. And makes you want to try it.     So we were there at 9pm and it was not busy but for some reason we and other people waited for 20 min.  Probably was understaffed but I counted 5 servers serving on 7 tables. Probably could do more but hey I don't run it.   Beef noodle soup was the highlight they were great. Wish the fresh made noodle Had tapioca in it to make chewier.    The Dan Dan.   Sucked.  I mean take noodles had spicey sesame oil and there you go.   Oh wait forgot there was a tiny bit of meat.    Other dishes we got were not memorable so   Would go back for beef noodle assuming I won at the tables. Haahaa
1274	0	I have experience much better service in a restroom. So upset with how we were treated and for no reason, we only wanted to sit and get something to drink. But that was even too difficult I guess. We had the 24 hour buffet pass, so we went to this one. Paid. Waited to get seated. Waited some more. Waited some more. I would say it was 15 minutes to wait to be seated, there was nobody seating people. Finally taken to a spot. We sat. We waited to get a drink. We waited some more. I told my friend to go get her food, I would wait and order the drinks. Waited some more. I had to flag someone down, then two servers argued about our table number and whose table it was. (Yes, ladies, everyone in the area heard you argue). Finally our server came, annoyed, and took our drink order. When she returned it was incorrect. *sigh* Reorder and wait. After that it I saw nobody interested to find out how we were doing, if we needed anything, or if we were alive. I do believe when the server arrived to clear the last of the plates I got a pleasant surprise of her rolling her eyes back when I spoke. Gosh, such love.  What was even more wonderful about surviving the cold looks from the staff was watching them ooze and gush over the older couple sitting ONE table away. They got red carpet treatment while we died of thirst. Not one server deserved a tip in that place for the service that they failed to give.  Food was decent. Nice selection for the price. No soup bowls for soup at either station. Boooooo. So if you eat soup on a plate or with your hands, your in business. Cupcakes looked great. They didn't taste great though. Just ok.
1275	0	Worst check in ever! Been in line for 30 minutes, worse than the dmv. slots are tight, cocktail waitresses even more so! the best thing about this place is that its across the street from Circus Circus.  oh and the happy hour at the R Steakhouse! 5$ bowl of steamed clams, oysters, row of 3 sirloin sliders or habanero chicken wings.
1276	1	Second only to In and out, Hubert Keller's Burger bar is a top burger joint.  Ive been there twice and have tasted four different creations of burger and they are all delicious.  I love how many different toppings you can choose, and they are all high quality ingredients.  You can go from really fancy (truffles, lobsters, Kobe beef) or just plain ol american.  Either way, it can form to any wallet.  If you dont want to choose your own ingredients they have pre-selected top burgers, the Blackjack burger was really good.  I thought the skinney fries were too overdone, but the sweet potato fries were good.  This time around we tried a milkshake, the Black and White one.  OMG milkshakegasm.  Delicious, creamy, chuncks of cookie dough and homemade chocolate whipped cream.  If that isnt you thing, I hear Burger Bar has the largest selection of beers on tap ON THE WHOLE STRIP.   The french man created the best over the top burger joint- good eats with a healthy dash of Vegas Flash.
1277	0	The first time I went to the MGM, I was pleased with everything. The second time I went, the service was not very good. Thinking that this was a fluke, I stayed there again. Big mistake.   We got there after 3 a.m. because of really bad traffic. Obviously not the MGM's fault. We got to our room and one of the window coverings was broken. I was concerned that somehow I would get blamed for breaking the window covering so I wanted to inform the front desk. I figured they may change our room or just say "don't worry about it." What I got was attitude. They said "It's 4 a.m., what do you want me to do about it?" Okay, well at least they know that the window covering is broken.   Fast forward to 5 a.m. I wake up to someone OPENING OUR DOOR. So far, I had only one hour of sleep. I wake up in alarm wondering if they double booked the room. According to my spouse, they knocked first. It was Engineering. They were there to fix the window covering. Who sends maintenance into a booked room at 5 a.m.?! How is this okay?  Then, a few hours later, they wake us up again with a phone call. They asked us if we had checked out because the maid service reported that we did. We had not checked out. At the end of our stay, we called the front desk and checked out. We asked them if any further action needed to be taken and they said that everything was taken care of.  They double charged us. We paid for the room online. When we had first got there they asked to see the credit card and they charged us again without our knowledge. My spouse called them to rectify the situation after our stay and they insisted that we had stayed two nights! I appalled at how awful this entire situation has been.
1278	1	I've been hearing about this place arguably being the best Thai in the states. I haven't been to enough to compare, but my first time experience with Lotus of Siam is pretty damn good.   When we rolled up, we had an awkward feeling about this place as the exterior seemed really dinky and the spaces around this strip mall have pretty much gone out of business. But as we saw people waiting around in the front for it to open....and asian, this was our good sign. It was like the moment Dorothy opened the front door to her house and stepped into Oz. They had seemed to done up the place really well and you really wouldn't have imagined it at its location.  It was pretty interesting as we sat down and literally had to flip through seven pages of the menu and absolutely had no idea what to order. The waiters were definitely honest with their suggestions. Their recommendations turned out to be some of the most unique flavors and tastes I've ever experienced.  I'm thinking that part of the reason why their food is so delicious is because they utilize their different flavors, textures, and consistencies so successfully.  We ordered the following: Nam Kao Tod Green Tofu Curry  Sai Oua (Northern Style Sausage) Drunken Noodles with Chicken Nam Prik Ong with Sticky Rice (Red Chili Dip) Coconut Ice cream with Fried Bananas   Amongst my uncle, cousin and myself, it was definitely way too difficult to rank our favorites; and we kept adding on to our tab because it's one of those places where you want to literally try everything on the menu.  We also kept hearing people mention that they had redone the place, maybe for more room to hang their awards and pictures of celebrities.  Chances of coming back? OF COURSE!!!!! (already on my list when I come back to Vegas)
1279	1	If you were only allowed to order two things at Bouchon, let those two things be their cheese danish and their french fries.  While having a lovely brunch at Bouchon on a Saturday morning (after I learned the hard way that they're not open for brunch on weekdays), I stuffed myself with their house french baguette, two different kinds of beignets, a cheese danish, waffles with strawberry and whip, THEN I proceeded to indulge in my boyfriend's plate of delicious french fries that came with his steak pomme frites.  My fingers and hand were stuck in a repetitive motion that circled from his plate to my mouth until his plate was virtually left with nothing but crumbs.  Now let's talk about their cheese danish.  If your mind is envisioning the flat cheese danish from your local starbucks, snap out of it.  Mr. Keller kicked it up ten notches when he created the flakey, muffin-size pastry dressed with a generous dollop of a decadent vanilla bean-cream cheese.  Pick one up from the Bouchon Bakery downstairs if you'd prefer to eat yours on the go.    Don't get me wrong... almost everything I tried was delicious.  But what sticks out in my mind a month and a half after my visit remains the cheese danish and fries.    The restaurant was filled with character and charm on a bright spring day atop the Venetian Tower.  Service staff was plentiful and friendly.
1280	0	Honestly not impressed. I've heard so much hype about their food and it really was no different then the cafeteria that is at my university. also, they messed up my order. i understand that times can get busy, but when i show up and there are only 4 people in line i would hope i can get the right order. Also, I'm not sure how good i feel about eating chicken that is in the shape of a ring LOL,  something tells me chickens don't grow like that.
1281	0	Shrimp and crab salad: the shrimp was rubbery and not cleaned.  Mini mac & cheese: passable with a liberal dose of salt and pepper.   Dirty glasses and, with a nearly empty restaurant, it took too long to get it. The hawaiian ribeye that my husband ordered was fantastic, though, hence the two stars.
1282	0	We went to the Spice Market Buffet for dinner tonight around 9:00PM. I have to give only one star for this place mainly because of the demeanor of a cashier by the name of Mona who seemed to be ignoring us by not looking at us and moving to the back of the counter. She basically ignored us for about 5 minutes. When another couple came up behind us she quickly said "Can I help you". She should not be working in a position of greeting the public. She should be fired. I will follow this up with a letter to the management  The food at the buffet was not bad although expensive at $36 per person.
1283	1	You won't have :better" pizza anywhere.  As good, perhaps, but not better. No way.  Had a slice of white and a slice of the pepperoni and wow.  From the crust to the perfect amount of cheese the right amount of toppings ... it's a secret only because there are no signs and unless you spot a person walking out with a pizzza box or slice on a plate you would never think to go down some random hallway ... but the secret is out.  The place was packed (very little seating) with people ordering deliciousness.    Will definitely go back on my next Vegas visit.
1284	1	This is the best Korean restaurant I've ever been!!!!!!!! The side dishes are great; the appetizers are awesome; the BBQ meat is so fresh and juicy.   We ordered steamed egg, chicken karage, and tuna kimbap for starters. Omgosh, they were all a fantastic. We ordered scallops, Korean prime kalbi, sweet corn, and enoki with bacon. I have never had such great kalbi before. The meat is so juicy and palatable, and I ate the meat with the sesame veggies in the house... it's like a taste of heaven.   Recommend recommend recommend!!!!
1285	0	So I have to preface this by saying I have not stayed here again since my previous review. BUT I did walk out to the pool deck last week around 3am to dip my toes in the water, and I was rudely turned away by the security guard who informed me that the pool is NO LONGER open 24/7. So the only reason I would ever stay here is nonexistent. SEE YA Hooters.
1286	0	Eh. That is the best word that expresses my experience at the buffet at the MGM.   There isn't anything too special at this buffet beside the fact they serve rock crab legs, other than that, the food here is just...there.   Nothing really stood out to me, yeah there was okay brisket and yes there was okay prime rib, but when in Vegas, your expectations are high, especially when it comes to buffets. If this buffet was, let's say in Bay Area, then this would probably be one of the better ones in the Bay. But because it's in Vegas, this ranks as one of the buffets on the bottom of my list. This is probably why the price of this buffet is 40% cheaper than the others.   If I were to describe this buffet in one sentence it would be this: "food that gets the job done." Because this is what this buffet is good for, a place where you can fill your body up. Don't expect a fine buffet experience, go to the cosmopolitan for that.  I would rather take an uber from the MGM to the cosmopolitan and spend that extra $15-20 to eat at the wicked spoon because its worth it. Take my word for it.
1287	1	Best Thai restaurant hands down. Where do I even begin!? We arrived during dinner rush, but honestly they're probably busy at any hour since it's been featured on Food Network, among other places. It is handy that they had iPads set up to where they can text you when they're ready to seat your party. There is also a bar area and a waiting room so you don't have to wait outside. Before dinner, we grabbed beers and Thai tea to drink in the waiting room while being able to sit and relax inside. They have photos of celebrities from movie stars to Food Network shows all over their walls, and the owner of the restaurant which was also the chef, popularly walked around to tables with which seemed to be many regulars praising him and greeting him. Our table was ready and we ordered the prawns which seemed to be most popular on all of the tables, and a duck noodle. Mind you, I'm not a fan of duck but it was crisp and fried to perfection in the most perfect sauce. The prawns were huge and flavorful. We also had a steak dish that came with a small sauce that is to die for. What had me was that they offer the Laos papaya salad that not many other places do. We ordered a spice level of 10 and we were dying but it was literally perfection. Everything was extremely good. I was disappointed to find out that they were out of mango sticky rice, so we settled for a fried banana and ice cream, which tasted similar to Filipino banana lumpia, but they were cut up into small pieces for an easier family style and small portioning. Guaranteed I will visit this place every time I go to Vegas. You won't be let down!
1288	0	Last time I went there were choices for the cotton candy martini's.. This time the rude bartender snapped at me and said NO, there isn't. My friend and I ordered a cotton candy martini regardless. He kept saying he was busy and would attend to our order soon. I told him to take his time and he snapped and said NO I WON'T... umm ok, I was just trying to be nice and not pressure the guy.   4 drinks and crappy service later, we paid and the bartender approached my friend when she paid and said "Sorry for the lousy service". Really? Admitting to the lousy service but not doing anything to improve it. Thumbs down. I'm seriously disappointed. I won't be returning. The Sugar factory's goblets made up for the bad service and not so great drinks.   I'm disappointed :(   OH and it was my birthday.
1289	1	I definitely would give this place a five star. Wait staff is attentive and the food was delicious. Hands down the best Thai food I've had ever! We waited an hour to eat but we were seated at the bar while we waited for a table. Great spot to converse and drink wine and beer.   The food did not fall short of expectations, it actually surpassed it. The atmosphere was very appealing. From the outside it looks like a hole in the wall, but it was actually very roomy and the decor was beautiful. Not to mention all the pictures of celebrities in their restaurant.  I would definitely recommend their crispy duck Panang curry and soft shell crab drunken noodles. You cannot go wrong with these dishes. It's very appealing to the taste buds, I never knew duck could taste so good!!!   I look forward to becoming a regular here!
1290	0	My friend and I had lunch buffet there since two free buffet vouchers were included in the room package.  However, I wouldn't eat here again even if we get another free buffet offer.  There was very few choices and they all tasted so so.  The ribs were dry and collard green tasted weird.  There was a little fly on the sweet shrimp sushi enjoying its meal. How appeptizing...Normally, dessert section is my favorite,  but the dessert selection was just okay.  If you were to spend $$ on a buffet, Harrah's has a much better deal and their buffet tastes much better!
1291	0	I'll start the review by saying that I have very mixed feelings about this hotel. There were definitely some good things about MGM, but overall we were left with a bad feeling about staying here, and will definitely not ever stay here again.      Before coming to Vegas all the way from Minnesota, I had booked a Grand King room, and was required to put down a deposit on the room, and then received an email confirmation saying that I had a RESERVATION for the Grand King. When we arrived at the hotel, the front desk informed us that we were unable to stay in the Grand King room anymore and would be placed in a Double Queen. Although the double queen wasn't so bad (it had a really nice view of a big green wall!), we were upset over the fact that we had reserved and expected the King. After expressing my dissatisfaction with the front desk, he said "I'm sorry about that." So I pressed a little further until finally he said the only thing he could do was offer me a buffet credit, which was really no help since we already had received a free buffet voucher online (after eating there, I now understand why they are so willing to offer so many free buffets...yuck). So, we ended up staying in the Queen for the weekend, and the room was pretty decent for the most part.      During checkout after our two night stay at the hotel, I again asked a different person at the front desk about the situation regarding the room, and she seemed very unwilling to talk to me and responded with "sorry about that." So then I asked her if this happens often, and she explained to me that MGM does not provide guests with room RESERVATIONS, they only provide guests with room REQUESTS. I guess if I am traveling halfway across the country to stay for the weekend, I would rather stay at a hotel that will have a guaranteed hotel room waiting for me when I get there.      Upon returning home from our trip, I provided feedback to the hotel online & explained our situation, hoping that they may attempt to resolve the issue, and was sent an automated email response within about 30 seconds containing an apology. Usually I'm very lenient with this sort of thing, since I work in the casino industry and have to deal with guest issues all the time, but usually when things like this happen, I'm used to seeing employees and the company acting like they at least care slightly, and I've always been under the assumption that Vegas resorts offer decent guest service. I guess I should lower my expectations next time.      Overall at MGM, we met some really great employees, and some really terrible employees. A lot of the people working here seem like they don't want to be here and didn't want to help us out (could be that we are a little younger, and they didn't think we would tip them).      However, there were some really great employees that offered us really great guest service, and were willing to help us with anything we needed. Some of the departments that really treated us with respect were the bell services desk and the house keeping crew.
1292	1	Came down here from Los Angeles for the weekend and we decided to stop here for breakfast. It was probably the best part out of all my trip. The food was great and our waitress was the sweetest friendliest lady we came across. I would definitely come back to Vegas just for this place!
1293	0	Booked hotel room through Orbitz and received Complimentary Breakfast/Brunch.    Noticed the low star ratings but since it was Free Breakfast/Brunch, Sure, why not!  The food here is Bleh...    Prices for breakfast and brunch ranges from $17.25-$25.99...NOT WORTH IT!  Trust me, Go elsewhere!    Most of the items were cold, hard and dry...Yuck!  The worst is the eggs benedict, OMG Disgusting!  If you must eat here, stick with the strawberries n creme, chips w/ taco meat, bacon, string beans and asparagus...  ******************* Apparently, MGM Grand charged us for the Breakfast/Brunch buffets.  When we checked in, the front desk clerk told us it was included with the room.  We are currently in the process of disputing the charges. They have yet to return our calls or emails...  ******************** Update: After weeks of phone calls and emails, MGM finally credited us back the excessive charges (7/11/13).  It shouldn't have taken this long...
1294	0	Not sure what happened to this place. I ate here on my previous trip to Vegas in 2006 and the food was decent, but this time, the breakfast buffet was pretty bad. The eggs literally had water sitting in the bottom of the pan and were beyond mushy and some of the other food just didn't look appetizing. We ate here 2 mornings and one morning we got this humongous glass of OJ and the other morning we got a glass of OJ that was meant for a baby...pretty weird and trying to get our servers attention on the 2nd visit for refills was pretty impossible. The highlight of the buffet was the omelette station. You can pretty much customize what you want in it, and is made to order; the wait was only around 5 minutes for one. Honestly, the only reason we ate here 2 mornings was because we had coupons from staying at PH and it was cheaper than the cafe in the hotel. We were pretty selective on our tastings the 2nd trip though.
1295	1	This is an exceptional Thai restaurant.  The food was fantastic, and there is a HUGE menu to choose from.  You have the perennial favorites like Pad Thai on up to the more rare things like crispy fried pork bellies.  We were impressed and wish it was closer to us.  Service was quick.  Even during lunch rush we had our food surprisingly fast.
1296	1	Excellent. Love the food, love the space. Standouts for me (I go 4 or 5 times a year) include:  1. The Cheese Danish. It's cupcake sized/shaped with a lemony cream cheese filling and flaky pastry.  2. Eggs Benedict. A thin, crispy English muffin..... need i say more?  3. The daily quiche. Always a winner and the green salad it comes with is key with it's bright flavor that provides a nice contrast to the savory quiche filling.  One thing I would say is Bouchon is my favorite for breakfast, not for dinner. Personal taste I'm sure, but I prefer the clean flavors of breakfast and dinner was just too busy for my taste, and too expensive.
1297	0	Just like so many first timers, I was extremely excited to try this place. I just wanted to go. So many great words were expressed about this place that I found myself craving to try this experience out. my GLUTEN FREE AND VEGAN folks, stay away if you're going for dessert. I was really hoping that I would be able to find at the very least two or three different options what I found was a scoop of sorbet was my only option. Even though I was kind of heart broken that I couldn't fully experience this cute little place, I went ahead and ordered my sorbet ... Well, my waitress forgot to bring it out. She brought out everyones food ( which I couldn't order anything) and then when she brought out dessert mine was missing. By the time she came back my friends were done with their meals and desserts that I had to tell her to forget about it. The place is really cute, the view of the strip is nice ( outside patio) but the service wasn't great and their aren't really options for us Gluten free and Vegan people. Want to go for the decor? I say go! cute little spot and it is an experience, but prepared to make your tummy grumble and growl if you are a Gluten and Dairy Free person.
1298	1	My girlfriend and I were really intrigued by this place because we're big fans of GR's tv shows and just the overall hype on his cooking history. This is probably the most excited we've been entering a restaurant. We expected top notch food and we got exactly that! Best onion rings ever and the burgers were insane; they had a very unprecedented flavor. We are definitely going back when we are able. 100% satisfied. From the atmosphere, to service, to the food... everything was what we expected and more. Burgr is fantastic and you should really try it. Freakin sensational.
1299	1	My sister and mom went for mothers day, Steaks' opening weekend. Their revue was good enough to get me on a plane from San Diego, and for them to extend their stay another day. I joined up and we went for dinner on Wednesday.   They were right...wow   The service was superb. They paid attention to EVERY TINY DETAIL. Napkins were re folded if someone got up, our drinks never got anywhere near empty, simply the best service I have ever had.  My sister and i split a medium rare porterhouse with the peppercorn sauce and mac &cheese and asparagus, my mom got the beef wellington.  Im rating everything as a  "10" period. The toffee cake and butter ice cream was stunning.  I am giving the front of the house and back of house both a 10. I can assure you as this is the Only Gordon Ramsay steakhouse, they DO know how to cook a steak and that's for freaking sure.    This is place isn't cheap, but isn't insane. Expect to pay around 100 each person plus tip. The food is worth it, and this comes from a guy who has no problems making complaints.   Make your reservations well ahead of time.
