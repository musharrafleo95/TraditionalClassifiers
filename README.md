# TraditionalClassifiers
This repository implements the basic machine learning classifiers for the problem of Yelp reviews classification. 
We assume the problem to be a binary classification problem.

The models implemented are :

  Naive Bayes in the nbc folder
  Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (linear) in the lr_svm folder, 
  Decision Trees, Bagged Decision Trees, Random Fforests, Boosted Decision Trees in the ensembles folder.
  
Please look at the individual folders README files for instructions on how to run.
